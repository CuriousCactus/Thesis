\section{Abstract}

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is becoming a serious global health threat, and the discovery of new, safe and effective antibiotics is required urgently\cite{ResistanceUS,davies2013drugs,ANIE:ANIE201209979}. A new class of antibiotic, namely sideophore-antibiotic conjugates, has shown promise in initial studies\cite{Page2013,Schalk2017}. Siderophores are used by bacteria for iron uptake, and so attaching antibiotics to them allows the antibiotic to be carried across cell membranes. This study investigates conjugates designed using a similar approach, but using bacterial autoinducers\cite{Waters2005} instead of siderophores. Autoinducers are required for coordination of bacterial behaviours and are involved in the control of swarming, virulence factor production and biofilm formation\cite{Miller2001}. 


The library was synthesised in two halves which were then coupled together using a copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition\cite{Tornoe2002,ANIE:ANIE2596}. The autoinducers were functionalised with azide groups and the antibiotics were functionalised with alkynes. The quorum sensing molecules produced by \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} were investigated as it is a significant human pathogen\cite{Bodey1983} which displays high resistance to many antibiotics\cite{Poole2004} and uses quorum sensing to coordinate its group behaviours\cite{Dubern2008}. Azido analogues of these autoinducers were coupled with alkyne analogues of ciprofloxacin, which was chosen as it is commonly used against \textit{P. aeruginosa}\cite{Macgowan1999} but resistance to it is developing\cite{Su2010}, and trimethoprim. It was hoped that the autoinducers would aid retention of the antibiotic in the cell, thus potentially increasing its potency or even restoring its efficacy against resistant strains.
