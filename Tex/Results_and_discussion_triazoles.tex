\subsection{Synthesis of the triazole-linked autoinducer-antibiotic conjugates\label{sec:Tris}}

\subsubsection{Optimisation of the click reaction}

Test reactions using N$_3$-C$_2$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL2N3} and the alkynyl ciprofloxacin derivative \compound{cmpd:Y4Cip} were performed to find conditions for the click reactions between the azido autoinducers and the alkynyl antibiotics (see \ref{tbl:HL2N3Y4Cip_opt} and \ref{sch:HL2N3Y4Cip_synth}). 
Stirring at r.t. had no effect even with an extended reaction time. Heating to 50 $^{\circ}$C did lead to slow formation of the product, but a mixture of the 1,4 \compound{cmpd:HL2T4Cip} and 1,5 \compound{cmpd:15HL2T4Cip} isomers was observed in an approximately 4:1 ratio by LCMS (see \ref{fig:14vs15}). It is possible that the Cu(I) catalyst was not involved in this reaction because it had been oxidised, and hence the mixture of products was formed by an uncatalysed cycloaddition. Such reactions are known to produce a mixture of products\cite{Rostovtsev2002}.

Use of the ligand tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine (THPTA) \compound{cmpd:THPTA} (see \ref{fig:THPTA}) led to some conversion at room temperature, however the reaction stopped before completion, probably due to oxidation of the Cu(I) catalytic species. When degassed solvent and an argon atmosphere were used the reaction proceeded to completion at room temperature in around 3 h.

\subsubsection{Synthesis of the autoinducer-ciprofloxacin and autoinducer-trimethoprim triazole conjugates}

Once conditions had been found for the click reaction, the synthesis of other conjugates was attempted. 
Two additional azides were kindly donated by members of the Spring group: 
the azido derivative of 3-oxo-C$_{12}$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HLO12N3} was synthesised by Ryan Howard, a master's student under my supervision\cite{Howard2015} and
the tail azide derivative of PQS \compound{cmpd:PQSN3} was synthesised by Dr Ysobel Baker\cite{Baker2015} (see \ref{fig:furtherazs}).

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Synthesis of the conjugates proved more difficult than expected, for several reasons. Firstly some compounds did not dissolve in the reaction solvent (50\% water/\textit{t}-BuOH) requiring addition of co-solvents such as \ce{CH2Cl2}. Secondly, some compounds were unstable: HSL derivatives hydrolysed upon attempted preparative HPLC purification and the 3-oxo-C$_{12}$-HSL conjugates degraded during the reaction. Finally, the reaction was highly air-sensitive which led to stalling. 
The most reliable procedure was determined over the course of several reactions, and is shown in \ref{sec:click_general}. 

Despite the unforeseen difficulties in synthesis of the conjugates enough material was successfully prepared for biological testing. The results of the reactions are shown in \ref{tbl:Clicks_AHLs_Cip}, \ref{tbl:Clicks_Quins_Cip}, \ref{tbl:Clicks_AHLs_Tri} and \ref{tbl:Clicks_Quins_Tri}. It was intended that the failed reactions would be repeated, but as preliminary biological testing (see \ref{sec:bio1}) proved unpromising it was decided that attention should be focused elsewhere.
