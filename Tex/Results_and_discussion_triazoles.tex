\subsection{Synthesis of autoinducer-antibiotic conjugate \compound{cmpd:HL2T4Cip}}

Test reactions using C$_4$-HSL analogue \compound{cmpd:HL2N3} and ciprofloxacin analogue \compound{cmpd:hexpipcip} were performed to find conditions for the click reactions between the azido autoinducers and the alkynyl antibiotics (see \ref{sch:HL2N3hexpipcip_synth} and \ref{tbl:HL2N3hexpipcip_opt}). Stirring at r.t. had no effect even with an extended reaction time. Heating to 50 $^{\circ}$C did lead to slow formation of the product, but a mixture of the 1,4 \compound{cmpd:HL2T4Cip} and 1,5 \compound{cmpd:15HL2T4Cip} isomers was observed \marginnote{check and include ratio from NMR?}. Use of the ligand tris[(1-benzyl-\textit{1H}-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA) \compound{cmpd:TBTA} lead to some conversion at room temperature, however the reaction stopped before completion, probably due to oxidation of the Cu(I) catalytic species. When degassed solvent and an argon atmosphere were used the reaction proceeded to completion at room temperature in around 3 h.

\subsection{Synthesis of the initial triazole-linked library}

Once conditions had been found for the click reaction, the synthesis of other conjugates was attempted. Synthesis of some conjugates proved more difficult than expected; AHLs hydrolysed upon HPLC purification, the 3-oxo-C$_{12}$-HSL conjugate degraded when subjected to column chromatography, and quinolones coordinated copper, thus inhibiting the click reactions. Nonetheless, several conjugates were produced for testing. The results of the reactions are shown in \ref{tbl:Clicks_AHLs_Cip}, \ref{tbl:Clicks_Quins_Cip}, \ref{tbl:Clicks_AHLs_Tri} and \ref{tbl:Clicks_Quins_Tri}.
