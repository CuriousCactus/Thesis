ahls are localised meijler
don't get into human cells


Hannah's experimental corrections:

1) The structures look quite big in the pdf, maybe make them smaller;

2) The font size in the structures could be smaller so that you can actually see the bond (e.g. 28 and 33 as examples where you cannot see the bond);

3) It is great that you are assigning the NMRâ€™s but you do not have to show that assignments in the actual spectra. People usually just show the clean spectra (see some previous thesis from the group e.g. Jamie's), or if you want to have extra, then show spectra with shifts and integration.
