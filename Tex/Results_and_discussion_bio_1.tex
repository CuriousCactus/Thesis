\subsubsection{Biological testing\label{sec:bio1}}


%We hypothesised that the lack of biological activity was a result of the compounds being unable to dissociate from the cell wall. To address this a sceond set of conjugates were prepared in collaboration with Professor Eddy Soleto, a visiting academic in the Spring group. 

%OR:

%you could go with something like: in parallel with the perpetration of xxx, a second ciprofloxicin alkyne was prepared by Eddie Soleto. and do the bio together. just be more positive nad view it as a collaboration, just because yours didn't work doesnt mean they didnt contribute to the knowledge that you need the biocleavable linker. In fact. he needed you and your azides! :) 

%However, initial results in YM64 (a PAO1 mutant lacking efflux pumps) show that the one compound that may show comparable results to ciprofloxacin is a control compound with a benzyl group attached. However, both compounds completely inhibited bacterial growth at all concentrations tested, so it is not clear if the compound is better than ciprofloxacin. Testing in PAO1 should be completed this week; as antibiotics are usually in this wild-type strain the difference between ciprofloxacin and the conjugate should show up without lowering the concentration.
