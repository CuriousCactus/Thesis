\subsubsection{Autoinducer-antibiotic conjugates}

The eight triazoles made in \ref{sec:Tris} (see \ref{fgr:finals_1}) were tested for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity in \textit{P. aeruginosa} PAO1\cite{Stover2000} and YM64\cite{Morita2001}.
PAO1 is the \textit{P. aeruginosa} wild-type strain.
YM64 is a mutant lacking all of the four major \textit{mex} operons for multidrug efflux pumps: \textit{mexAB-oprM}, \textit{mexXY}, \textit{mexCD-oprJ} and \textit{mexEF-oprN}, making it more sensitive to many antibiotics and hence able to show up moderate effects more clearly.

\subsubsubsection{Antibacterial and anti-biofilm testing against YM64}

In YM64 at 5 h the HSL-Cip conjugates \compound{cmpd:HL2T4Cip}, \compound{cmpd:HL4T4Cip} and \compound{cmpd:HL6T4Cip} showed slight activity at the highest concentration, but not as much as ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip}.
This activity was not visible by 24 h (see \ref{fgr:YM64_24h}) and the compounds had no effect on biofilm formation (see \ref{fgr:YM64_biofilms}).

A dose-dependant response was expected for these results, however this was not seen except for a slight effect at 5 h in YM64 for some compounds. The dose-dependant response might potentially be seen if higher concentrations were tested, although there could be problems with compound solubility. Conversely, the dose-dependant response might be seen for ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip} if lower concentrations were tested. Smaller `steps' in concentration could also be tested after establishing the range over which the dose-dependant response is seen.

The very high readings in the biofilm assays for ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip} (see \ref{fgr:YM64_biofilms} and \ref{fgr:PAO1_biofilms}) could be due to sub-MIC concentrations of the antibiotic causing the bacteria to respond by forming a protective biofilm. This effect has been reported with cefotaxim, amoxicillin, azithromycin\cite{Aka2015,Hoffman2005}, tobramycin, amikacin, streptomycin and gentamicin, but oddly not with ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip}\cite{Gupta2016,Machado2013}, although this could be due to the exact conditions of growth.

\subsubsubsection{Antibacterial and anti-biofilm testing against PAO1}

In PAO1 \compound{cmpd:HL6T4Cip} showed similar activity to ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip} at the highest concentration (see \ref{fgr:PAO1_5h}), but not at lower concentrations. All other compounds did not show activity, and again there was no activity at 24 h or against biofilms. 
Increased biofilm formation is again seen with intermediate concentrations of ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip}, although PAO1 seems to be overwhelmed at the highest concentrations.

\subsubsection{Cleavable homoserine lactone-ciprofloxacin conjugates\label{sec:bioC}}

The eight cleavable HSL-Cip conjugates, two controls and two alkynes described in \ref{sec:cleavable} (see \ref{fgr:finals_cleavable}) were tested for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity in \textit{P. aeruginosa} YM64.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Here there was more success, although the activity was still not as high as for ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip}.
The HSL-Cip conjugates with \textit{N}-(acetoxymethoxycarbonyl) linkers (R = H) showed activity at high concentrations. A longer linker seems to give higher activity; \compound{cmpd:HL4THCip} and \compound{cmpd:HL6THCip} showed activity comparable with ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip} at high concentrations.
Unfortunately the control \compound{cmpd:BnTHCip} and alkyne \compound{cmpd:Y4HCip} with \textit{N}-(acetoxymethoxycarbonyl) linkers (R = H) showed higher activity than the conjugates, indicating that the HSL head wasn't contributing to the activity of the conjugates.

The conjugates with an \textit{N}-(acetoxyethoxycarbonyl) linker (R = Me) did not show any activity. This suggests that they either didn't enter cells or weren't suitable substrates for esterases.
The \textit{N}-(acetoxyethoxycarbonyl) linked alkyne (R = Me) did show some activity, indicating that maybe it could penetrate cells more easily than the conjugates due to its lower molecular weight and/or lower polarity.
