\subsubsection{Biological testing}


%We hypothesised that the lack of biological activity was a result of the compounds being unable to dissociate from the cell wall. To address this a sceond set of conjugates were prepared in collaboration with Dr Eddy Stoleto, a visiting academic in the Spring group. 

%OR:

%you could go with something like: in parallel with the perpetration of xxx, a second ciprofloxicin alkyne was prepared by Eddie Stoleto. and do the bio together. just be more positive nad view it as a collaboration, just because yours didn't work doesnt mean they didnt contribute to the knowledge that you need the biocleavable linker. In fact. he needed you and your azides! :)
