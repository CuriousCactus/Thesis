\subsection{Chapter overview}

\subsubsection{Head groups}

The head groups used in this study are shown in \ref{fig:head_groups}. The cyclohexanol derivatives were synthesised as a diastereomerically pure racemate, whereas the cyclopentanol derivatives were synthesised as separate enantiomers. Unfortuantely, cyclopentanone derivatives were not synthesised, and would be an obvious future addition to the library. The 2-methoxybenzene derivatives do not have precedents as quorum sensing modulators in the literature, but they were included so as to be compared with the 3-methoxybenzene derivatives.

\subsubsection{Library construction}

As Ganguly \textit{et al.}\cite{Ganguly2001} synthesised their conjugate from Br-C$_4$-HCTL, it was envisaged that a branching strategy could be used to produce two sets of conjugates (see \ref{sch:branching_synth_general}). The first set would be formed by the S$_N$2 reaction of the relevant bromide with methyl ciprofloxacin. The second set would be made by displacing the bromide with azide, then performing a click reaction with the alkynyl ciprofloxacin derivative \compound{cmpd:Y4Cip} made previously to form the triazole-linked product. Ketone conjugates would be formed by oxidation of the alcohols.
