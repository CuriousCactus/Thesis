\subsubsection{Synthesis of homoserine lactone-ciprofloxacin triazole conjugates with cleavable linkers\label{sec:cleavable}}

In addition to the conjugates shown in the previous section, a further collection was synthesised in collaboration with Professor Eddy Sotelo, a visiting researcher in the Spring group. Professor Sotelo synthesised two alkyne-linked ciprofloxacin derivatives \compound{cmpd:Y4HCip} and \compound{cmpd:Y4MeCip} (see \ref{fig:cleavable_Ys}), both with cleavable linkers (see \ref{sec:cleavable_intro}).

Professor Sotelo then performed click reactions using the AHL azide derivatives \compound{cmpd:HL2N3}, \compound{cmpd:HL4N3} and \compound{cmpd:HL6N3} shown in \ref{sec:HSLs} to form a library of conjugates (see \ref{fig:cleavable_finals}). It was hoped that these conjugates would enter the cell and then be cleaved by esterases to release ciprofloxcin (see \ref{sec:cleavable_intro}).

Two control compounds \compound{cmpd:BnTHCip} and \compound{cmpd:BnTMeCip} with benzyl head groups were also produced by Professor Sotelo (see \ref{fig:cleavable_controls}). It was hoped that these would show whether the AHL head group is required for activity.
