\subsection{Introduction}

The first part of this project was focused on producing a library of autoinducer-antibiotic conjugates with the hope of increasing the potency of the antibiotics and possibly restoring their action against resistant strains of bacteria. \textit{P. aeruginosa} autoinducers were used, in particular C$_4$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL4}, HHQ \compound{cmpd:HHQ} and PQS \compound{cmpd:PQS} (see \ref{fgr:PA_autoinducers}). Azido derivatives of these compounds were coupled to alkynyl dervitatives of antibiotics, specifically ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip} and trimethoprim \compound{cmpd:Tri} (see \ref{fgr:ABs}), using a copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition\cite{Tornoe2002,ANIE:ANIE2596}.

\subsubsection{Azido autoinducer derivatives}

The structure-activity relationships in HHQ \compound{cmpd:HHQ} and PQS \compound{cmpd:PQS} have been previously studied \cite{Lu2012,Lu2014,Hodgkinson2010}, and it was shown various substitutions on the benzene ring could be made without significantly decreasing activity. The 6-azido derivatives (see \ref{fgr:azHHQPQS}) were chosen for this study as routes to them have previously been found\cite{Baker2015}.

Alteration of the lactone group of C$_4$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL4} and other HSL derivatives is known to significantly decrease activity, especially where the number of H-bond donors or acceptors is altered \cite{Galloway2011}. Hence, the azide group was included on the tail of C$_4$-HSL  \compound{cmpd:HL4}. Acyl tail length is known to play an important role in affinity, so three derivatives of C$_4$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL4} were synthesised: N$_3$-C$_2$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL2N3}, N$_3$-C$_4$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL4N3} and N$_3$-C$_6$-HSL \compound{cmpd:HL6N3} (see \ref{fig:HL_anas}).

\subsubsection{Alkynyl antibiotic derivatives}

Ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:Cip} (see \ref{fgr:ABs}) is second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections including \textit{P. aeruginosa} \cite{Oliphant2002}.
The structure-activity relationships for ciprofloxacin have been investigated \cite{Renau1996} and modifications at the cyclopropane and piperazine groups were found not to cause loss of activity. It was decided an alkyne tail would be added onto the free NH of the piperazine ring, as this position is more synthetically accessible. Alkynyl ciprofloxacin derivative \compound{cmpd:Y4Cip} (see \ref{fgr:Cip_anas}) was synthesised in this study (see \ref{sec:Y4Cip}), and two cleavable alkynyl ciprofloxacin derivatives \compound{cmpd:Y4HCip} and \compound{cmpd:Y4MeCip} were synthesised by Dr Eddy Sotelo and combined with some of the azido HSL derivatives made in this study (see \ref{sec:HSLs} and \ref{sec:cleavable}).

Trimethoprim (see \ref{fgr:ABs}) is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor used primarily to treat bladder infections\cite{Brogden1982}. It is active against several significant human pathogens including \textit{Streptococcus pneumoniae} and \textit{Haemophilus influenzae}.\todo{It doesn't kill Staph A...} 
The choice to of alkyne tail attachment point (see \ref{fgr:Y4Tri}) is based on the use of that same point in a fluorogenic trimethoprim tag synthesised by Jing \textit{et al}\cite{Jing2013}.

\subsubsection{Autoinducer-antibiotic conjugates}

A copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition\cite{Tornoe2002,ANIE:ANIE2596}, commonly referred to as a click reaction (although this is a more general term), was used to join each combination of autoinducer and antibiotic together (see \ref{sch:QSAB_synth_overv}). %This modular approach would allow the library to be easily expanded by adding more autoinducers or antibiotics, or indeed other groups such as siderophores, fluorescent or affinity tags, or resin beads.
