\section{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I would like to thank David Spring for the opportunity to work on this very interesting topic. I would
also like to thank Hannah Sore for guidance and support through the later stages of the project, and Eddy
Sotelo and Bin Yu for collaboration and useful discussions. Thank you to Mark Eldridge and Suzie Forrest for
help with learning biochemical techniques, to Martin Welch for guidance and advice on data interpretation and
especially to Tom O’Brien for stepping in to do some of the testing. Thanks also to Matt Pond, Melvyn Orriss,
Nic Davies and Naomi Hobbs for help with equipment and glassware and to Tom O’Brien, Jill Vaughan and
Tommy Osberger for proof-reading. Most importantly, I would like to thank Yssy Baker for proof-reading, help,
support, advice and encouragement.

Outside of the lab, I would like to say a huge thank-you to all of the wonderful friends and family, and of course Oli, who helped me get to this point, and to Sidney Sussex Boat Club for being a welcome distraction throughout.
