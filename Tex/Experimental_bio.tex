\subsection{Biological testing}

Compounds were tested against \textit{P. aeruginosa} PAO1\cite{bibid} and YM64\cite{bibid}.

The compounds were tested in PAO1, and YM64 which is missing 4 main efflux pumps.
Antibacterial activity was measured by measurement of turbidity at 595 nm at 5 h and 24 h.
The compounds were tested at 6 concentrations between 2 and 0.0625 $\mu$M in LB in 96-well plates.

\subsubsection{Antibiotic susceptibility}

Make overnight cultures (in 10 ml LB @ 37 oC).
Dilute 1/100 to make 20 ml (200 ul culture, 19.8 ml LB) per 2 plates.
Add 99 ul diluted culture to all wells except blanks and ‘Just LB’ wells (96-well plate, flat-bottomed wells). Remember to make 2 if doing biofilm inhibition testing after!
Add 100 ul LB to the ‘Just LB’ wells.
Add 1 ul compound solutions from the master plates.
Stick on adhesive cover (remove edges, DO NOT USE A LID).
Record OD
Place the plate in shaker @ 37 oC, 100 rpm, 
Record the OD every 1h for 8h, then at 16h, 24h and 48h.

\subsubsection{Quantification of biofilms}

Prepare two plates according to steps 1-6 of ‘MIC testing’.
Incubate one for 24 h and one for 48 h (this can be the one from the MIC test), both @ 37 oC, 100 rpm.
Record OD
Aspirate out culture (don’t touch sides).
Add 120 ul water then aspirate again. Repeat x3.
Add 120 ul 0.1 % crystal violet, leave for 15 min.
Aspirate out crystal violet.
Add 120 ul water then aspirate again. Repeat x3.
Add 30 % acetic acid, leave for 15 min.
Vortex plate.
Read plate.

\subsubsection{Biofilm inhibition}

\subsubsection{Biofilm dispersal}

Make overnight cultures (toothpick in 10 ml LB @ 37 oC).
Dilute 1/100 to make 20 ml (200 ul culture, 19.8 ml LB) per 2 plates.
Add 99 ul diluted culture to all wells except the ‘Just LB’ wells (96-well plate, flat-bottomed wells). Make 2 plates per master plate per strain.
Add 100 ul LB to the ‘Just LB’ wells.
Shake for 24 h or 48 h @ 37 oC, 100 rpm.
Record OD
Add 1 ul compound solutions from the master plates.
Record OD
Shake for 24 h @ 37 oC, 100 rpm.
Record OD
Do steps 2-9 of ‘Biofilm inhibition testing’.
