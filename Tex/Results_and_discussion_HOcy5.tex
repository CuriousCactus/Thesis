\subsubsection{Synthesis of the 2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol head groups \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_SS} and \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_RR} \label{sec:HOcy5NH2}}

Synthesis of the cyclopentanol derivatives began with the synthesis of (1\textit{S},2\textit{S})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_SS} and (1\textit{R},2\textit{R})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_RR} (see \ref{sch:HOcy5NH2_synth}), using a procedure reported by Overman and Sugai\cite{Aube1992,Overman1985,Overman1985a}.
These precursors were synthesised by opening cyclopentene oxide \compound{cmpd:Ocy5} using (\textit{S})-1-phenylethan-1-amine \compound{cmpd:NH2MeBn} to give approximately equal amounts of two diastereomers, \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NHMeBn_SSS} and \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NHMeBn_RRS}, which were separated using column chromatography. 
The removal of the methylbenzyl groups proved more difficult than expected, with the conditions reported by Overman and Sugai\cite{Overman1985} yielding only a salt of the starting material.
After several attempts under various conditions (including using the free amine vs. the salt, varying the temperature, ensuring the dryness of the reagents and adding acetic acid), an approach using \ce{H2} gas was attempted (see \ref{tbl:HOcy5NH2_opt}). This proceeded smoothly at 5 atm to give the two enantiomers of 2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol, \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_SS} and \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_RR}, both in quantitative yield.

However, a large number of impurities were observed by LCMS (see \ref{fig:HOcy5NH4Br_SS_impurities}), and so three new strategies were attempted: protection of the alcohol (see \ref{sec:TBDMS}), installing the linker on methyl ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:CipMe} and then attaching the head group by peptide coupling (see \ref{sec:CipMe_linker}), and using 4-chlorobutyryl chloride \compound{cmpd:Cl4Cl} as the linker instead of 4-bromobutyryl chloride \compound{cmpd:Cl4Br} (see \ref{sec:Cl4Cl}).

\subsubsection{TBDMS protection route \label{sec:TBDMS}}

The first attempt at an alternative strategy for the synthesis of the conjugates involved TBDMS protection of the alcohol (see \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4_retro_B}). It was envisaged that protection would eliminate enough of the side reactions with products shown in \ref{fig:HOcy5NH4Br_SS_impurities} that intermediates Br-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Br_SS} and N$_3$-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4N3_SS} could be purified. The TBDMS group could be removed later in the synthesis using TBAF or acid.

\subsubsubsection{Synthesis of TBDMS-protected (1\textit{S},2\textit{S})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_SS}}

The synthesis began with the optimisation of the protection of (1\textit{S},2\textit{S})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_SS} with a TBDMS group on the alcohol (see \ref{sch:TBSOcy5NH4Br_SS_synth}).
This reaction proved more problematic than expected, possibly due to the amine group interfering with the reaction at the alcohol and/or the high polarity of the starting material causing problems with solubility in the reaction mixture and extraction during the work-up. Conditions attempted are summarised in \ref{tbl:TBSOcy5NH4Br_SS_opt}. Protection attempts using TBDMSCl were generally unsuccessful, but eventually a method employed by Wu et. al\cite{Wu2012} using TBDMSOTf was found to produce the desired product in excellent yield. Water was used for the work-up rather than \ce{NH4Cl} (sat. aq.), as the acidic work-up protonated the product. The TEA was removed during column chromatography instead.

The TBDMS protected (1\textit{S},2\textit{S})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:TBSOcy5NH2_SS} was reacted with 4-bromobutyryl chloride \compound{cmpd:Cl4Br} to form Br-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-TBDMS-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:TBSOcy5NH4Br_SS}. The reaction was observed to go to completion by TLC, but it became apparent that the product was reacting further during concentration and purification. Adding sodium azide to the mixture obtained after the failed purification attempts was observed to convert the remaining Br-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-TBDMS-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:TBSOcy5NH4Br_SS} to N$_3$-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-TBDMS-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:TBSOcy5NH4N3_SS}. 
A sequential one-pot reaction was therefore used, so that the reactive intermediate did not need to be isolated.

N$_3$-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-TBDMS-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:TBSOcy5NH4N3_SS} and the alkynyl ciprofloxacin derivative \compound{cmpd:Y4Cip} were subjected to standard click conditions (see \ref{sec:click_general}), and the (\textit{SS})-TBDMS-cyclopentanol-Cip triazole conjugate \compound{cmpd:TBSOcy5NH4T4Cip_SS} was synthesised in very good yield. However, removal of the TBDMS group proved difficult. Deprotection using 1.5 eq. TBAF in THF proceeded slowly, reaching completion in 5 d. Increasing the amount of TBAF to 8 eq. allowed the reaction to proceed overnight.
Purification of the final conjugate \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4T4Cip_SS} by column chromatography was not successful due to streaking and poor separation. Purification using DOWEX resin and \ce{CaCO3}\cite{Kaburagi2007} was attempted, but the product could not be recovered from the resin.
The purification method could probably be optimised, e.g. by varying the solvent used with the resin, but ultimately this route was abandoned due to the reduction in number of steps afforded by the two methods described below.

Given the side-reactions and low yields associated with the literature synthesis of the S$_N$2 conjugates proposed by Ganguly et. al\cite{Ganguly2011}, an alternative synthesis was investigated, involving building up the linker on the ciprofloxacin side before coupling with the head group (see \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4_retro_D}).

\end{scheme}

%a
The first step of the synthesis was an S$_N$2 reaction between Boc-protected 4-bromobutyric acid \compound{cmpd:tBuOO4Br} methyl ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:CipMe} (see \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4CipMe_RR_synth}). This reaction used fairly harsh conditions (16 h at 100 $^{\circ}$C), but early on in the synthesis before the head group was installed. Hence the possibility of side reactions between the bromide and the amine was removed. Intermediate \compound{cmpd:tBuOO4CipMe} was obtained in acceptable yield after column chromatography (49.9 \%).
%b
Intermediate \compound{cmpd:tBuOO4CipMe} was deprotected in excellent yield using TFA in \ce{CH2Cl2} to give carboxylic acid \compound{cmpd:HOO4CipMeTFA}. Scale-up of this reaction allowed the easy synthesis of 600 mg of this useful intermediate, which can be coupled with various amine head-groups to create a library.
%c
Carboxylic acid \compound{cmpd:HOO4CipMeTFA} was first coupled with (1\textit{R},2\textit{R})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_RR} using standard peptide coupling conditions to give cyclopentanol-CipMe conjugate \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4CipMe_RR}. Purification by column chromatography was attempted twice with poor results, before moving on to using preparative HPLC, which gave \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4CipMe_RR} cleanly in 38.7 \% yield.
Coupling was also performed with (1\textit{S},2\textit{S})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_SS} to give the enantiomer \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4CipMe_SS} in 54.7 \% yield.

Direct comparisons of routes are not possible without repeating syntheses using this new method, but if it is assumed that peptide coupling of homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride \compound{cmpd:SHLHCl} to carboxylic acid \compound{cmpd:HOO4CipMeTFA} would have a similar yield to the coupling with (1\textit{R},2\textit{R})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_RR}, approximate comparisons can be made.
The synthesis described in \ref{sec:HCTL} has an overall yield of 10.7 \%, whereas the route shown in \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4CipMe_RR_synth} for \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4CipMe_SS} has an overall yield of 26.1 \%. Moreover, if the yield starting from the head group (which may be expensive, difficult to synthesise and/or unstable) is considered, the yield is 54.7 \% vs. 10.7 \%.
Therefore, this route is recommended for further investigation if the library is to be expanded.

A downside to this route is that it cannot branch towards the triazole-coupled library in the same way that the route in \ref{sec:HCTL}. A carboxylic acid intermediate with a triazole in the chain could presumably be synthesised, but this would be rather pointless given that the triazole library was initially proposed so that the two sides could be joined by the click reaction.
Therefore, an alternative route to the azide was proposed, via a more stable chloride intermediate (see \ref{sec:Cl4Cl}).

A final attempt at a branching strategy was attempted, via a chloride rather than a bromide intermediate (see \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4_retro_C} and \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4_retro_A} for comparison). The bromide intermediate was initially chosen as it was used by Ganguly et. al\cite{Ganguly2011}, but it was hoped that using a chloride would cut out some of the side reactions seen with the more reactive bromide.

Attempts at this route began with the synthesis of Cl-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{RR}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Cl_RR}. Standard Schotten-Baumann conditions failed to produce significant amounts of product. If prolonged reaction times were allowed, degradation of the acid chloride to the carboxylic acid was observed. The reason for this is unclear, but it is possible that bromide ions present in small amounts in previous reactions were helping to catalyse the reaction of the acid chloride. Archer \textit{et al.}\cite{Archer1953} propose that bromide ions can react with acid chlorides to form acid bromides, which are then more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
As no bromide ions are present in this reaction, different conditions were sought in order to increase the rate.

As (1\textit{R},2\textit{R})-2-aminocyclopentan-1-ol \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH2_RR} is fairly polar, it is likely that it was staying in the aqueous layer to some extent even when deprotonated, thus keeping the two reactants apart.
Therefore, the solvent system and base were changed to neat \ce{CH2Cl2} and TEA.
This produced Cl-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{RR}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Cl_RR} in good yield (64.1 \%). Unlike the bromide \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Br_SS}, the chloride \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Cl_RR} was stable when concentrated.

Cl-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{RR}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Cl_RR} was converted to N$_3$-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{RR}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4N3_RR} by reaction with sodium azide. The reaction was slower than with previous bromides (\textasciitilde16 h vs. \textasciitilde2 h), but much cleaner than with Br-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Br_SS} (see \ref{sec:init_branch}).

The enantiomers Cl-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Cl_SS} and N$_3$-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{SS}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4N3_SS} were synthesised in lower yields, in part because of the smaller amounts being used.

The cyclopentanol-Cip triazole conjugates \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4T4Cip_SS} (\textit{SS}) and \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4T4Cip_RR} (\textit{RR}) were synthesised using standard click conditions (see \ref{sec:click_general}). Yields were poor primarily due to problems with purification, including losses on the preparative HPLC column and high polarity leading to losses during extraction from aqueous solvents. However, as enough of the compounds was obtained for biological testing the purification was not optimised further.

The S$_N$2 reaction of Cl-C$_4$-cyclopentanol-(\textit{RR}) \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4Cl_RR} and methyl ciprofloxacin \compound{cmpd:CipMe} was attempted (see \ref{sch:HOcy5NH4CipMe_SN2}) using the microwave conditions described previously (see \ref{sec:2MeO}), to see if the chloride produced better results compared with the bromide. However, as was seen with the other microwave reactions, a substantial amount of the disubstituted product \compound{cmpd:(HOcy5NH4)2CipMe+_RR} was seen by LCMS (in an approx 1:1 ratio with the desired product \compound{cmpd:HOcy5NH4CipMe}). As a higher-yielding route had already been found (see \ref{sec:CipMe_linker}), this route was abandoned.

With (unfortunately not branching) routes to the S$_N$2 and click conjugates established (see \ref{sec:CipMe_linker} and \ref{sec:Cl4Cl} respectively), attention was turned to the cyclohexanol derivatives.
