abstract = {In bioluminescent bacteria growing in shake flasks, the enzyme luciferase has been shown to be synthesized in a relatively short burst during the period of exponential growth. The luciferase gene appears to be completely inactive in a freshly inoculated culture; the pulse of preferential luciferase synthesis which occurs later is the consequence of its activation at the level of deoxyribonucleic acid transcription which is attributed to an effect of a “conditioning” of the medium by the growing of cells. Although cells grown in a minimal medium also exhibit a similar burst of synthesis of the luminescent system, the amount of synthesis is quantitatively less, relative to cell mass. Under such conditions, added arginine results in a striking stimulation of bioluminescence. This is attributed to a stimulation of existing patterns of synthesis and not to induction or derepression per se.},

abstract = {Clinically significant antibiotic resistance has evolved against virtually every antibiotic deployed. Yet the development of new classes of antibiotics has lagged far behind our growing need for such drugs. Rather than focusing on therapeutics that target in vitro viability, much like conventional antibiotics, an alternative approach is to target functions essential for infection, such as virulence factors required to cause host damage and disease. This approach has several potential advantages including expanding the repertoire of bacterial targets, preserving the host endogenous microbiome, and exerting less selective pressure, which may result in decreased resistance. We review new approaches to targeting virulence, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and propose that in addition to targeting virulence, new antimicrobial development strategies should be expanded to include targeting bacterial gene functions that are essential for in vivo viability. We highlight both new advances in identifying these functions and prospects for antimicrobial discovery targeting this unexploited area.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is the leading cause of iatrogenic infections in critically ill patients, especially those undergoing mechanical ventilation. In this study, we investigated the effects of the universal signaling molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1.\n\nRESULTS: The addition of 0.1 nM, 1 nM, and 10 nM exogenous AI-2 to P. aeruginosa PAO1 increased biofilm formation, bacterial viability, and the production of virulence factors. However, compared to the 10 nM AI-2 group, higher concentrations of AI-2 (100 nM and 1 $\mu$M) reduced biofilm formation, bacterial viability, and the production of virulence factors. Consistent with the changes in morphology, gene expression analysis revealed that AI-2 up-regulated the expression of quorum sensing-associated genes and genes encoding virulence factors at lower concentrations and down-regulated these genes at higher concentrations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that exogenous AI-2 acted in a dose-dependent manner to regulate P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence factors secretion via modulating the expression of quorum sensing-associated genes and may be targeted to treat P. aeruginosa biofilm infections.},

abstract = {The marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi controls its bioluminescence by a process known as quorum sensing. In this process, autoinducer molecules are detected by membrane-bound sensor kinase/response regulator proteins (LuxN and LuxQ) that relay a signal via a series of protein phosphorylation reactions to another response regulator protein, LuxO. Phosphorylated LuxO indirectly represses the expression of the proteins responsible for bioluminescence. Integral to this quorum sensing process is the function of the phosphotransferase protein, LuxU. LuxU acts to shuttle the phosphate from the membrane-bound proteins, LuxN and LuxQ, to LuxO. LuxU is a 114 amino acid residue monomeric protein. Solution NMR was used to determine the three-dimensional structure of LuxU. LuxU contains a four-helix bundle topology with the active-site histidine residue (His58) located on ??-helix C and exposed to solution. The active site represents a cluster of positively charged residues located on an otherwise hydrophobic protein face. NMR spin-relaxation experiments identify a collection of flexible residues localized on the same region of LuxU as His58. The studies described here represent the first structural characterization of an isolated, monomeric bacterial phosphotransferase protein. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A major reason for bacterial persistence during chronic infections is the survival of bacteria within biofilm structures, which protect cells from environmental stresses, host immune responses and antimicrobial therapy. Thus, there is concern that laboratory methods developed to measure the antibiotic susceptibility of planktonic bacteria may not be relevant to chronic biofilm infections, and it has been suggested that alternative methods should test antibiotic susceptibility within a biofilm. In this paper, we describe a fast and reliable protocol for using 96-well microtiter plates for the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms; the method is easily adaptable for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This method is based on bacterial viability staining in combination with automated confocal laser scanning microscopy. The procedure simplifies qualitative and quantitative evaluation of biofilms and has proven to be effective for standardized determination of antibiotic efficiency on P. aeruginosa biofilms. The protocol can be performed within approximately 60 h.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS)-dependent biofilm formation and motility were controlled by AqsR in Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1. QS-controlled phenotypes appeared to be inhibited by indole and the aqsR mutant had the same phenotypes. We demonstrated that the turnover rate of AqsR became more rapid without the N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal, and that indole could increase the expression of many protease and chaperone proteins. The addition of exogenous indole decreased the expression of two AqsR-targeted genes: AOLE_03905 (putative surface adhesion protein) and AOLE_11355 (L-asparaginase). The overexpression of AqsR in Escherichia coli was impossible with the indole treatment. Surprisingly, our [(35)S]methionine pulse-labelling data demonstrated that the stability and folding of AqsR protein decreased in the presence of indole without changing aqsR mRNA expression in E. coli. Interestingly, indole resulted in a loss of TraR-dependent traG expression in an Agrobacterium tumefaciens indicator strain. However, when indole was added after incubation with exogenous AHL, indole could not inhibit the TraR-dependent expression of the traG promoter. This indicated that AHL-bound TraR could be protective against indole, but TraR without AHL could not be active in the presence of indole. Here, we provided evidence for the first time showing that the indole effect on QS-controlled bacterial phenotypes is due to inhibited QS regulator folding and not a reduced QS signal.},

PIPC and IPM demonstrated relatively high permeation both with penetration rates at day 5 of 50%, whereas AMK and GM, which are aminoglycosides, showed low permeation both with penetration rates after day 1 of less than 25%. Among the 4 fluoroquinolones, LVFX and SPFX demonstrated excellent permeation with penetration rates that reached 100% from day 0 to 5, while OFLX and CPFX showed almost the same permeation as IPM.

The Gram-negative quorum-sensing systems were first discovered and extensively characterized in the marine Vibrios. Some components of the Vibrio systems are present in the classical genetic model organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Both organisms encode a signal receptor of the LuxR family, SdiA, but not a corresponding signal-generating enzyme. Instead, SdiA of Salmonella detects and responds to signals generated only by other microbial species. Conversely, E. coli and Salmonella encode the signal-generating component of a second system (a LuxS homologue that generates AI-2), but the sensory apparatus for AI-2 differs substantially from the Vibrio system. The only genes currently known to be regulated by AI-2 in Salmonella encode an active uptake and modification system for AI-2. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether Salmonella uses AI-2 as a signal molecule or whether AI-2 has some other function. In E. coli, the functions of both SdiA and AI-2 are unclear due to pleiotropy. Genetic strategies to identify novel signalling systems have been performed with E. coli and Providencia stuartii. Several putative signalling systems have been identified, one that uses indole as a signal and another that releases what appears to be a peptide. The latter system has homologues in E. coli and Salmonella, as well as other bacteria, plants and animals. In fact, the protease components from Providencia and Drosophila are functionally interchangeable.},

abstract = {During quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri, the luminescence, or lux, operon is regulated in a cell density-dependent manner by the activator LuxR in the presence of an acylated homoserine lactone autoinducer molecule [N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone]. LuxR, which binds to the lux operon promoter at a position centered at -42.5 relative to the transcription initiation site, is thought to function as an ambidextrous activator making multiple contacts with RNA polymerase (RNAP). The specific role of the alpha-subunit C-terminal domain (alphaCTD) of RNAP in LuxR-dependent transcriptional activation of the lux operon promoter has been investigated. The effects of 70 alanine substitution variants of the alpha subunit were determined in vivo by measuring the rate of transcription of the lux operon via luciferase assays in recombinant Escherichia coli. The mutant RNAPs from strains exhibiting at least twofold-increased or -decreased activity in comparison to the wild type were further examined by in vitro assays. Since full-length LuxR has not been purified, an autoinducer-independent N-terminally truncated form of LuxR, LuxRDeltaN, was used for in vitro studies. Single-round transcription assays were performed using reconstituted mutant RNAPs in the presence of LuxRDeltaN, and 14 alanine substitutions in the alphaCTD were identified as having negative effects on the rate of transcription from the lux operon promoter. Five of these 14 alpha variants were also involved in the mechanisms of both LuxR- and LuxRDeltaN-dependent activation in vivo. The positions of these residues lie roughly within the 265 and 287 determinants in alpha that have been identified through studies of the cyclic AMP receptor protein and its interactions with RNAP. This suggests a model where residues 262, 265, and 296 in alpha play roles in DNA recognition and residues 290 and 314 play roles in alpha-LuxR interactions at the lux operon promoter during quorum sensing.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been a mainstay in the treatment of bacterial diseases. The most notable representative, ciprofloxacin, possesses potent antimicrobial activity; however, a rise in resistance to this agent necessitates development of novel derivatives to prolong the clinical lifespan of these antibiotics. Herein we have synthesized and analyzed the antimicrobial properties of a library of N-acylated ciprofloxacin analogues. We find that these compounds are broadly effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with many proving more effective than the parental drug, and several possessing MICs ≤1.0 $\mu$g/ml against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bartonella species. An analysis of spontaneous mutation frequencies reveals very low potential for resistance in MRSA compared to existing fluoroquinolones. Mode of action profiling reveals that modification of the piperazinyl nitrogen by acylation does not alter the effect of these molecules towards their bacterial target. We also present evidence that these N-acylated compounds are highly effective at killing intracellular bacteria, suggesting the suitability of these antibiotics for therapeutic treatment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We reconstructed two sets of focused libraries against the quorum-sensing transcription factors LasR and RhlR, respectively. Opposing the prediction that both proteins should have the same binding site for HSL, it was surprising to find that these two related proteins respond to different structural motifs. This suggests that the HSL binding site differs in these proteins. We also found that subtle structural modifications to the agonists yielded compounds with antagonist activity. We performed a series of assays to show that inhibition of quorum sensing by these antagonists significantly reduced the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation.},

By cloning a lasB::lacZ fusion and a lasR gene under control of the lac promoter in Escherichia coli, we have developed a quantitative bioassay for PAI. We have used this assay to follow the purification of PAI from cell-free culture supernatant fluids in which P. aeruginosa or E. coli containing the P. aeruginosa gene required for autoinducer synthesis, lasI, had been grown. Chemical analyses indicated the purified material was 3-oxo-N-(tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl)dodecanamide. To confirm this assignment, the compound was synthesized and the synthetic compound was shown to have chemical and biological properties identical to those of PAI purified from culture supernatant fluids. The elucidation of the PAI structure suggests therapeutic approaches toward control of P. aeruginosa infections.},

abstract = {The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is an important quorum-sensing molecule in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that also mediates its own packaging and transport by stimulating outer membrane vesicle (OMV) formation. Because OMVs have been implicated in many virulence-associated behaviors, it is critical that we understand how they are formed. Our group proposed the bilayer-couple model for OMV biogenesis, where PQS intercalates into the outer membrane, causing expansion of the outer leaflet and consequently inducing curvature. In accordance with the model, we hypothesized that PQS must be transported from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane before it can initiate OMV formation. We initially examined two laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa and found significant strain-dependent differences. PQS export correlated strongly with OMV production, even though equivalent amounts of total PQS were produced by both strains. Interestingly, we discovered that poor OMV producers sequestered the majority of PQS in the inner membrane, which appeared to be the result of early saturation of the export pathway. Further analysis showed that strain-specific PQS export and OMV biogenesis patterns were stable once established but could be significantly altered by changing the growth medium. Finally, we demonstrated that the associations described for laboratory strains also held for three clinical strains. These results suggest that factors controlling the export of PQS dictate OMV biogenesis. This work provides new insight into PQS-controlled virulence in P. aeruginosa and provides important tools to further study signal export and OMV biogenesis.},

abstract = {Surface adhered bacterial colonies or biofilms are an important problem in medical and food industries. Bacteria use a chemical language to monitor their quorum and to express virulence factors, which eventually help them in colonization and manifestation of an infection. The LasR-LasI and RhlR-RhlI quorum-sensing (QS) systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa control expression of virulence factors in a population density-dependent fashion. In this study we investigated the role of synthetic analogs to RhlR-RhlI system of P. aeruginosa strains (PAO-1; wild-type and mutants JP-1, PDO-100, and JP-2) responsible for production of acyl-homoserine lactones-2; butanol homoserine lactone (AHL-2; C(4)-HSL). We synthesized double (QS1207) and single (QS0108) sulfur analogs against (C(4)-HSL; AHL-2), an autoinducer of Pseudomonas QS system. Extensive biological investigation of these analogs suggested a growth promoting activity for these analogs in Pseudomonas controlling biofilm production and exo-protease secretion. We hypothesized that these thiolactone analogs could be potentially utilized as potent drug-delivery vehicles against biofilm-producing pathogens. As a proof of principle we conjugated the single sulfur analog QS0108 with the broad-spectrum antibiotic, ciprofloxacin (QS0108-Cip). The QS analog-antibiotic conjugate was significantly more effective at disrupting both the nascent and mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa than the free antibiotic.},

Similarly, the rhl system consists of the transcriptional activator protein RhlR and of RhlI, which directs synthesis of the autoinducer PAI-2 (formerly referred to as factor 2). To study the interrelation between the two P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing systems, we fused a lacZ reporter gene to lasR, rhlR, and rhlA and monitored expression of these three genes under various conditions. Our data indicate that lasR and rhlR are expressed in a growth-dependent manner, with activation of each gene occurring during the last half of log-phase growth. We also show that the las quorum-sensing system controls the rhl quorum-sensing system in two ways. First, we found that LasR and PAI-1 activated rhlR transcription. Second, we showed that PAI-1 blocked PAI-2 from binding to RhlR, thereby inhibiting the expression of rhlA. Our data thus indicate that the las system exerts two levels of control on RhlR, transcriptional and posttranslational.},

abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generated using chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin as selective agents. These mutants displayed a multidrug phenotype and overexpressed an outer membrane protein of 50 kDa, which was shown by Western blot analysis to correspond to OprN. A cosmid clone harbouring the oprN gene was isolated by partial complementation of a mutant deficient in OprM, the outer membrane component of the mexAB-oprM efflux operon. Antibiotic-accumulation studies indicated that OprN was part of an energy-dependent antibiotic-efflux system. Sequencing of a 6180bp fragment from the complementing cosmid revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs), which exhibited amino acid similarity to the components of the mexAB-oprM and mexCD-oprJ efflux operons of P. aeruginosa. The ORFs were designated MexE, MexF and OprN. Mutation of the mexE gene eliminated the multidrug-resistance phenotype in an OprN-overexpressing strain, but did not affect the susceptibility profile of the wild-type strain. Expression of the mexEF-oprN operon was shown to be positively regulated by a protein encoded on a 1.5 kb DNA fragment located upstream of mexE and belonging to the LysR family of transcriptional activators. The presence of a plasmid containing this DNA fragment was sufficient to confer a multidrug phenotype onto the wild-type strain but not onto the mexE mutant. Evidence is provided to show that the mexEF-oprN operon may be involved in the excretion of intermediates for the biosynthesis of pyocyanin, a typical secondary metabolite of P. aeruginosa.},

Twenty-one fluorogenic probes containing one and two fluoresceins (FAM), or a FAM-JOE pair, and one or two BHQ1 quenchers were synthesized using non-nucleoside reagents and "click chemistry" post-modification on solid phase and in solution. The probes were tested in real-time PCR using an $\sim$300-bp-long natural DNA fragment as a template. The structural prerequisites for lowering the probe background fluorescence and increasing the end-plateau fluorescence intensity were evaluated and discussed.},

In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the absence of one or more components of the quorum-sensing system results in a significant reduction in virulence. Recent advances in the past year have demonstrated that the quorum-sensing signal molecule 3O-C12-HSL is also a potent stimulator of multiple eukaryotic cells and thus may alter the host response during P. aeruginosa infections. Therefore, via the regulation of multiple factors and the production of 3O-C12-HSL, quorum-sensing systems have a significant effect on the virulence of the bacteria and also on how the host responds to P. aeruginosa infections.},

abstract = {Vibrio harveyi regulates the expression of bioluminescence (lux) in response to cell density, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. In V. harveyi, two independent quorum-sensing systems exist, and each produces, detects, and responds to a specific cell density-dependent autoinducer signal. The autoinducers are recognized by two-component hybrid sensor kinases called LuxN and LuxQ, and sensory information from both systems is transduced by a phosphorelay mechanism to the response regulator protein LuxO. Genetic evidence suggests that LuxO-phosphate negatively regulates the expression of luminescence at low cell density in the absence of autoinducers. At high cell density, interaction of the sensors with their cognate autoinducers results in dephosphorylation and inactivation of the LuxO repressor. In the present report, we show that LuxN and LuxQ channel sensory information to LuxO via a newly identified phosphorelay protein that we have named LuxU. LuxU shows sequence similarity to other described phosphorelay proteins, including BvgS, ArcB, and Ypd1. A critical His residue (His 58) of LuxU is required for phosphorelay function.},

abstract = {In this work, we aim to design and synthesize prodrugs of gatifloxacin targeting organic cation transporter (OCT), monocarboxylate transporter (MCT), and ATB (0, +) transporters and to identify a prodrug with enhanced delivery to the back of the eye. Dimethylamino-propyl, carboxy-propyl, and amino-propyl(2-methyl) derivatives of gatifloxacin (GFX), DMAP-GFX, CP-GFX, and APM-GFX, were designed and synthesized to target OCT, MCT, and ATB (0, +) transporters, respectively. An LC-MS method was developed to analyze drug and prodrug levels in various studies. Solubility and log D (pH 7.4) were measured for prodrugs and the parent drug. The permeability of the prodrugs was determined in the cornea, conjunctiva, and sclera-choroid-retinal pigment epitheluim (SCRPE) and compared with gatifloxacin using an Ussing chamber assembly. Permeability mechanisms were elucidated by determining the transport in the presence of transporter specific inhibitors. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+), nicotinic acid sodium salt, and $\alpha$-methyl-DL-tryptophan were used to inhibit OCT, MCT, and ATB (0, +) transporters, respectively. A prodrug selected based on in vitro studies was administered as an eye drop to pigmented rabbits, and the delivery to various eye tissues including vitreous humor was compared with gatifloxacin dosing. DMAP-GFX exhibited 12.8-fold greater solubility than GFX. All prodrugs were more lipophilic, with the measured log D (pH 7.4) values ranging from 0.05 to 1.04, when compared to GFX (log D: -1.15). DMAP-GFX showed 1.4-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold improvement in permeability across the cornea, conjunctiva, and SCRPE when compared to GFX. Moreover, it exhibited reduced permeability in the presence of MPP+ (competitive inhibitor of OCT), indicating OCT-mediated transport. CP-GFX showed 1.2-, 2.3-, and 2.5-fold improvement in permeability across the cornea, conjunctiva, and SCRPE, respectively. In the presence of nicotinic acid (competitive inhibitor of MCT), the permeability of CP-GFX was reduced across the conjunctiva. However, the cornea and SCRPE permeability of CP-GFX was not affected by nicotinic acid. APM-GFX did not show any improvement in permeability when compared to GFX across the cornea, conjunctiva, and SCRPE. Based on solubility and permeability, DMAP-GFX was selected for in vivo studies. DMAP-GFX showed 3.6- and 1.95-fold higher levels in vitreous humor and CRPE compared to that of GFX at 1 h after topical dosing. In vivo conversion of DMAP-GFX prodrug to GFX was quantified in tissues isolated at 1 h after dosing. The parent drug-to-prodrug ratio was 8, 70, 24, 21, 29, 13, 55, and 60% in the cornea, conjunctiva, iris-ciliary body, aqueous humor, sclera, CRPE, retina, and vitreous humor, respectively. In conclusion, DMAP-GFX prodrug enhanced solubility, log D, as well as OCT mediated delivery of gatifloxacin to the back of the eye.},

abstract = {Bacteria use small diffusible molecules to exchange information in a process called quorum sensing. An important class of autoinducers used by Gram-negative bacteria is the family of N-acylhomoserine lactones. Here, we report the discovery of a previously undescribed nonenzymatically formed product from N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone; both the N-acylhomoserine and its novel tetramic acid degradation product, 3-(1-hydroxydecylidene)-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidine-2,4-dione, are potent antibacterial agents. Bactericidal activity was observed against all tested Gram-positive bacterial strains, whereas no toxicity was seen against Gram-negative bacteria. We propose that Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes this tetramic acid as an interference strategy to preclude encroachment by competing bacteria. Additionally, we have discovered that this tetramic acid binds iron with comparable affinity to known bacterial siderophores, possibly providing an unrecognized mechanism for iron solubilization. These findings merit new attention such that other previously identified autoinducers be reevaluated for additional biological functions.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence generated by the Vibrio fischeri Lux system consumes oxygen and reducing power, and it has been proposed that cells use this to counteract either oxidative stress or the accumulation of excess reductant. These models predict that lux expression should respond to redox conditions; yet no redox-responsive regulator of lux is known. We found that the luxICDABEG operon responsible for bioluminescence is repressed by the ArcAB system, which is activated under reducing conditions. Consistent with a role for ArcAB in connecting redox monitoring to lux regulation, adding reductant decreased luminescence in an arc-dependent manner. ArcA binds to and regulates transcription from the luxICDABEG promoter, and it represses luminescence both in the bright strain MJ1 and in ES114, an isolate from the squid Euprymna scolopes that is not visibly luminescent in culture. In ES114, deleting arcA increased luminescence in culture approximately 500-fold to visible levels comparable to that of symbiotic cells. ArcA did not repress symbiotic luminescence, but by 48 h after inoculation, ArcA did contribute to colonization competitiveness. We hypothesize that inactivation of ArcA in response to oxidative stress during initial colonization derepresses luxICDABEG, but that ArcAB actively regulates other metabolic pathways in the more reduced environment of an established infection.},

abstract = {Mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 that were deficient in the ability to produce proteases that degrade casein were detected among the survivors of chemical mutagenesis. One such mutant (PDO31) showed reduced production of elastolytic activity, beta-hemolytic activity, and pyocyanin. A 4.3-kb EcoRI fragment from a gene bank of PAO1 that complemented defects in PDO31 was found. Transposon mutagenesis and deletion derivatives of the clone were used in conjunction with complementation tests to determine the physical location of the gene of interest. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (rhlR) encoding a putative 27.6-kDa protein (RhlR) with homology to autoinducer-responsive regulators of quorum sensing systems such as LuxR of Vibrio fischeri and LasR of P. aeruginosa. Further sequence analysis downstream of rhlR revealed an independently transcribed gene (rhlI) that encodes a putative 22.2-kDa protein with homology to members of the family of autoinducer synthetases, such as LuxI of V. fischeri and LasI of P. aeruginosa. The rhlRI sequences were also recently reported by others (U.A. Ochsner and J. Reiser, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 6424-6428, 1995) as an autoinducer-mediated regulation mechanism for rhamnolipid biosurfactant synthesis in P. aeruginosa PG201. Mutants with defects in rhlR or rhlI were constructed in PAO1 by gene replacement, using clones modified by Tn501 insertion. Compared with the wild type, the rhlR and rhlI mutants both showed defects in the production of elastase, LasA protease, rhamnolipid, and pyocyanin. Transcription from the gene for elastase, as measured with a lasB-cat fusion, demonstrated that production of elastase was subject to cell density-dependent gene activation in PAO1. However, transcription of lasB-cat in the rhlI mutant, which had lost the presumptive autoinducer synthetase (predicted to activate RhlR), showed low basal activity and had lost all cell density-dependent transcription of lasB. Thus, RhlR-RhlI represent the second autoinducer-responsive regulatory mechanism found in P. aeruginosa that controls expression of multiple virulence factor exoproducts, including elastase.},

abstract = {The second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century have witnessed important changes in ecology, climate and human behaviour that favour the development of urban pests. Most alarmingly, urban planners are faced now with the dramatic expansion of urban sprawl, where the suburbs of our cities are growing into the natural habitats of ticks, rodents and other pests. Also, many city managers now erroneously assume that pest-borne diseases are relics that belong to the past. All these changes make timely a new analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of present- day urban pests on health. Such an analysis should lead to the development of strategies to manage them and reduce the risk of exposure. To this end, WHO has invited international experts in various fields – pests, pest-related diseases and pest management – to provide evidence on which to base policies. These experts contributed to the present report by identifying the public health risk posed by various pests and appropriate measures to prevent and control them. This book presents their conclusions and formulates policy options for all levels of decision-making to manage pests and pest-related diseases in the future.},

abstract = {The synthesis of "designer" dendrimers and dendrons with sulfonimide units at every branching point is reported. The synthesis is based on a series of (regio)selective functionalization reactions of amines and sulfonamides allowing precise control of the dendrimers' shape, the number of branches in each generation, and their peripheral decoration with functional groups. In principle, structurally different branches can be incorporated at any position within the dendrimer structure at will. Structurally perfect symmetrical and two-faced "Janus"-type dendrimers, as well as dendrimers and dendrons with intended interstices were synthesized on a preparative scale and fully characterized. Oligosulfonimide dendrons of various generations bearing an aryl bromide functional group at their focal points were attached to a p-phenylene core with the aid of Suzuki cross-coupling reactions resulting in dendrimers with photoactive terphenyl cores. The structure and the high purity of all dendritic sulfonimides were confirmed by means of (1)H and (13)C NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and elemental analysis. The utility of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for the analytical characterization of these dendrimers was evaluated in comparison to electrospray ionization. Two model branched oligosulfonimides were characterized in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Reaction selectivities and conformation of sulfonimide branching points were rationalized by DFT calculations.},

abstract = {Virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa include hydrogen cyanide (HCN). This secondary metabolite is maximally produced at low oxygen tension and high cell densities during the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase. The hcnABC genes encoding HCN synthase were identified on a genomic fragment complementing an HCN-deficient mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1. The hcnA promoter was found to be controlled by the FNR-like anaerobic regulator ANR and by the quorum-sensing regulators LasR and RhlR. Primer extension analysis revealed two transcription starts, T1 and T2, separated by 29 bp. Their function was confirmed by transcriptional lacZ fusions. The promoter sequence displayed an FNR/ANR box at -42.5 bp upstream of T2 and a lux box centered around -42.5 bp upstream of T1. Expression of the hcn genes was completely abolished when this lux box was deleted or inactivated by two point mutations in conserved nucleotides. The lux box was recognized by both LasR [activated by N-(oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone] and RhlR (activated by N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone), as shown by expression experiments performed in quorum-sensing-defective P. aeruginosa mutants and in the N-acyl-homoserine lactone-negative heterologous host P. fluorescens CHA0. A second, less conserved lux box lying 160 bp upstream of T1 seems to account for enhanced quorum-sensing-dependent expression. Without LasR and RhlR, ANR could not activate the hcn promoter. Together, these data indicate that expression of the hcn promoter from T1 can occur under quorum-sensing control alone. Enhanced expression from T2 appears to rely on a synergistic action between LasR, RhlR, and ANR.},

abstract = {The formation of complex bacterial communities known as biofilms begins with the interaction of planktonic cells with a surface in response to appropriate environmental signals. We report the isolation and characterization of mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 defective in the initiation of biofilm formation on an abiotic surface, polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic. These mutants are designated surface attachment defective (sad ). Two classes of sad mutants were analysed: (i) mutants defective in flagellar-mediated motility and (ii) mutants defective in biogenesis of the polar-localized type IV pili. We followed the development of the biofilm formed by the wild type over 8h using phase-contrast microscopy. The wild-type strain first formed a monolayer of cells on the abiotic surface, followed by the appearance of microcolonies that were dispersed throughout the monolayer of cells. Using time-lapse microscopy, we present evidence that microcolonies form by aggregation of cells present in the monolayer. As observed with the wild type, strains with mutations in genes required for the synthesis of type IV pili formed a monolayer of cells on the PVC plastic. However, in contrast to the wild-type strain, the type IV pili mutants did not develop microcolonies over the course of the experiments, suggesting that these structures play an important role in microcolony formation. Very few cells of a non-motile strain (carrying a mutation in flgK ) attached to PVC even after 8h of incubation, suggesting a role for flagella and/or motility in the initial cell-to-surface interactions. The phenotype of these mutants thus allows us to initiate the dissection of the developmental pathway leading to biofilm formation.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human pathogen associated with a variety of life-threatening nosocomial infections. This organism produces a range of virulence factors which actively cause damage to host tissues. One such virulence factor is pyocyanin, known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. Previous studies had identified a novel compound capable of strongly inhibiting the production of pyocyanin. It was postulated that this inhibition results from modulation of an intercellular communication system termed quorum sensing, via direct binding of the compound with the LasR protein receptor. This raised the possibility that the compound could be an antagonist of quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa, which could have important implications as this intercellular signaling mechanism is known to regulate many additional facets of P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. However, there was no direct evidence for the binding of the active compound to LasR (or any other targets). Herein we describe the design and synthesis of a biotin-tagged version of the active compound. This could potentially be used as an affinity-based chemical probe to ascertain, in a direct fashion, the active compound's macromolecular biological targets, and thus better delineate the mechanism by which it reduces the level of pyocyanin production.},

The ampicillin derivative 7b (HKI 9924154) and the corresponding amoxicillin derivative 8 (HKI 9924155) represent the most active compounds.

abstract = {Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are binuclear metallohydrolases that have a multitude of biological functions and are found in fungi, bacteria, plants and animals. In mammals, PAP activity is linked with bone resorption and over-expression can lead to bone disorders such as osteoporosis. PAP is therefore an attractive target for the development of drugs to treat this disease. A series of penicillin conjugates, in which 6-aminopenicillanic acid was acylated with aromatic acid chlorides, has been prepared and assayed against pig PAP. The binding mode of most of these conjugates is purely competitive, and some members of this class have potencies comparable to the best PAP inhibitors yet reported. The structurally related penicillin G was shown to be neither an inhibitor nor a substrate for pig PAP. Molecular modelling has been used to examine the binding modes of these compounds in the active site of the enzyme and to rationalise their activities.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) regulates the production of virulence factors and the maturation of biofilms in many bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The QS cascade is activated by the interaction of bacterial signaling molecules, called autoinducers (AIs), with their corresponding regulatory proteins. Here, we report a series of studies to define the stereochemical preferences of synthetic agonists and perform docking studies to understand the microenvironment of the binding site in P. aeruginosa QS regulators. One of the key findings of this work is that the ring structure and the absolute and relative stereochemistries of the amide and hydroxyl groups dictate the agonist activity. This study aids in determining important structural and stereochemical characteristics necessary for interaction with the QS regulatory proteins, thus expanding our understanding of their inducer binding sites. ??2006 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Racemic fluoxetine consists of R- and S-fluoxetine, which are metabolized to R- and S-norfluoxetine, respectively. This study was designed to compare brain levels achieved with R-fluoxetine to those achieved with racemic fluoxetine in healthy subjects using fluorine-19 (19-F) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In all, 13 healthy volunteers received study drug for 5 weeks using a dosing schedule designed to achieve steady state for 20 mg/day racemic fluoxetine, 80 mg/day R-fluoxetine, or 120 mg/day R-fluoxetine. The resulting brain drug levels were measured using 19-F MRS. At 5 weeks, the racemate, 80 and 120 mg/day R-fluoxetine groups had mean brain levels of 25.5, 34.9, and 41.4 microM, respectively. In the serum, R-norfluoxetine, which is thought to be an inactive metabolite, accounted for 17, 71, and 63% of the fluoxetine/norfluoxetine concentration, respectively. When the relative proportion of active to total species in serum are taken into account, the data suggest that doses of R-fluoxetine greater than 120 mg/day would be needed to achieve brain levels of active drug comparable to 20 mg/day of racemate. The 120 mg/day R-fluoxetine group experienced a mean increase in QTc interval of 44 ms, with one individual having an increase of 89 ms, which suggests that higher doses may not be tolerable. While these data support the use of MRS to aid in defining the therapeutic dose range for drug development, they also highlight the need for additional studies with concurrent animal models to establish the validity of using serum drug/metabolite ratios to interpret MRS determined brain drug levels.},

abstract = {Sulfamates are important functional groups in certain areas of current medicinal chemistry and drug development. Alcohols and phenols are generally converted into the corresponding primary sulfamates (ROSO(2)NH(2) and ArOSO(2)NH(2), respectively) by reaction with sulfamoyl chloride (H(2)NSO(2)Cl). The lability of the O-sulfamate group, especially to basic conditions, usually restricts this method to a later stage of a synthesis. To enable a more flexible approach to the synthesis of phenolic O-sulfamates, a protecting group strategy for sulfamates has been developed. Both sulfamate NH protons were replaced with either 4-methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl. These N-protected sulfamates were stable to oxidising and reducing agents, as well as bases and nucleophiles, thus rendering such masked sulfamates suitable for multi-step synthesis. The protected sulfamates were synthesised by microwave heating of 1,1'-sulfonylbis(2-methyl-1H-imidazole) with a substituted phenol to give an aryl 2-methyl-1H-imidazole-1-sulfonate. This imidazole-sulfonate was N-methylated by reaction with trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, which enabled subsequent displacement of 1,2-dimethylimidazole by a dibenzylamine (e.g. bis-2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine). The resulting N-diprotected, ring-substituted phenol O-sulfamates were further manipulated through reactions at the aryl substituent and finally deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid to afford a phenol O-sulfamate. The use of 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl was particularly attractive because deprotection occurred quantitatively within 2 h at room temperature with 10% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. The four key steps in the protocol described [reaction of 1,1'-sulfonylbis(2-methyl-1H-imidazole) with a phenol, methylation, displacement with a dibenzylamine and deprotection] all proceeded in very high yields.},

abstract = {The antibiotic albomycin is transported into cells of Escherichia coli K-12 by the same uptake system as the iron-supplying ferrichrome complex. The iron-complexing hydroxamate moieties of albomycin and ferrichrome are structurally similar. During the phase of rapid iron uptake the chelators were not found in the cells. In order to understand the antibiotic activity of albomycin, it was labeled in the hydroxamate with tritium and in the presumed antibiotically active area with radioactive sulfur. While the tritium label was not retained by the cells, part of the sulfur label was taken up and concentrated 500-fold within the cell. The sulfur was not incorporated into proteins or nucleic acids since it was recovered as a low molecular weight component. Gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-2 revealed one tritium-labeled and two sulfur-labeled cleavage products in the incubation medium. We conclude that albomycin is actively transported via its ferrichrome-like portion into the cells and that the growth-inhibitory moiety is released by hydrolysis intracellularly and remains there.},

@article{Qin2007,
abstract = {The regulation of the lux operon (luxICDABEG) of Vibrio fischeri has been intensively studied as a model for quorum sensing in proteobacteria. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis previously identified several non-Lux proteins in V. fischeri MJ-100 whose expression was dependent on LuxR and 3-oxo-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL). To determine if the LuxR-dependent regulation of the genes encoding these proteins was due to direct transcriptional control by LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL or instead was due to indirect control via an unidentified regulatory element, promoters of interest were cloned into a lacZ reporter and tested for their LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL dependence in recombinant Escherichia coli. The promoters for qsrP, acfA, and ribB were found to be directly activated via LuxR-3-oxo-C6-HSL. The sites of transcription initiation were established via primer extension analysis. Based on this information and the position of the lux box-binding site near position -40, all three promoters appear to have a class II-type promoter structure. In order to more fully characterize the LuxR regulon in V. fischeri MJ-100, real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to study the temporal expression of qsrP, acfA, and ribB during the exponential and stationary phases of growth, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to compare the binding affinities of LuxR to the promoters under investigation. Taken together, the results demonstrate that regulation of the production of QsrP, RibB, and AcfA is controlled directly by LuxR at the level of transcription, thereby establishing that there is a LuxR regulon in V. fischeri MJ-100 whose genes are coordinately expressed during mid-exponential growth.},

Stirring urea suspended in AcOH in the presence of a catalytic amt. of Hg(OAc)2 with diketene 3 hrs. (slight exothermic effect) gave 79% acetoacetic acid ureide, m. 142-4°; no reaction took place in the absence of Hg salt.  Similar reaction in the presence of HgSO4 was very vigorous (mixt. came to spontaneous boil) and gave in 3 hrs. 61% 6-methyluracil, m. 308-10°.  PhNHCONH2 and diketene in the presence of Hg(OAc)2 similarly gave 55% acetoacetic acid 1-phenylureide, m. 144-5°.  Urethane similarly gave in 1.5 days 24% acetoacetyl deriv., m. 70-3°.  Keeping 3.1 g. AcCl, 0.6 g. Hg(OAc)2, and 1.2 g. urea 12 hrs. gave 34% acetylurea, m. 208-9°; EtCOCl similarly gave 25% propionylurea, m. 206-7°; no reaction took place with RCOCl in the absence of Hg salts.  Keeping 1 g. urea in 5 ml. PrCHO with 0.2 g. Hg(OAc)2 0.5 hr. gave 100% polymeric butylideneurea, m. 153-6°; without Hg salts the reaction gave only 11% yield.  Dimedone and 30% aq. MeNH2 in 12 hrs. gave I, m. 150-1°, which with diketene in AcOH at reflux 3 hrs. gave 80% putative II, m. 227-9°.  II was also formed in 53% yield when 1.2 g. I and 0.3 g. Hg(OAc)2 in AcOH were treated with 1.2 ml. diketene and kept 3 hrs.; when Hg salt was omitted, the yield was smaller.  Keeping 15 ml. diketene in 15 ml. AcOH with 0.2 g. Hg(OAc)2 at 20° gave a mixt. from which Me2CO, AcOH, and Ac2O were distd. and the residue was chromatographed on Al2O3 to yield 2,6-dimethylpyrone, 2,2,4-trimethyl-6-oxo-1,3-dioxin, b7 82-3°, n20D 1.4630, and 2,4-dimethylpyronecarboxylic acid, which was detected chromatographically.

abstract = {Acylated homoserine lactone molecules are used by a number of gram-negative bacteria to regulate cell density-dependent gene expression by a mechanism known as quorum sensing (QS). In Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa, QS or cell-to-cell signaling controls expression of a number of virulence factors, as well as biofilm differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role played by the las and rhl QS systems during the early stages of static biofilm formation when cells are adhering to a surface and forming microcolonies. These studies revealed a marked difference in biofilm formation between the PAO1 parent and the QS mutants when glucose, but not citrate, was used as the sole carbon source. To further elucidate the contribution of lasI and rhlI to biofilm maturation, we utilized fusions to unstable green fluorescent protein in concert with confocal microscopy to perform real-time temporal and spatial studies of these genes in a flowing environment. During the course of 8-day biofilm development, lasI expression was found to progressively decrease over time. Conversely, rhlI expression remained steady throughout biofilm development but occurred in a lower percent- age of cells. Spatial analysis revealed that lasI and rhlI were maximally expressed in cells located at the substratum and that expression decreased with increasing biofilm height. Because QS was shown previously to be involved in biofilm differentiation, these findings have important implications for the design of biofilm prevention and eradication strategies.},

abstract = {Quinolone class of antibacterial agents has considerable attention to find new useful antibacterial agents. Therefore, a series of N-substituted piperazinylquinolones bearing (5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methyl moiety were synthesized and evaluated against a variety of bacteria. The methylene-bridged nitrofuran functionality has been recently used in oxazolidinone class of antibacterial agents containing piperazinyl moiety by introducing ranbezolid as a 5-nitrofuran analog of eperzolid. The results of antibacterial evaluation revealed that the influence of (5-nitrofuran-2-yl) attachment to the 7-piperazinylquinolones against different bacterial species depends on the type of substituents at the N-1 and C-8 positions. Better results were obtained with ethyl at N-1 and CF at C-8 in the term of activity against Bacillus subtilis and E. coli. While, the optimum activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia was entailed by a molecule possessing cyclopropyl at N-1 and CH at C-8.

The currently accepted practice is to employ self-consistent-field (SCF) harmonic frequencies that have been scaled to reproduce experimentally observed fundamental frequencies. This procedure introduces systematic errors that result from a recognizable flaw in the method, namely that the correct ZPVE, G(O), is not one half the sum of the fundamental vibrational frequencies. Until better methods for accurately determining ZPVEs are presented, we recommend using different scaling factors for the determination of ZPVEs than those used to compare theoretically determined harmonic frequencies to observed fundamentals.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as an important pathogen during the past two decades. It causes between 10% and 20% of infections in most hospitals. Pseudomonas infection is especially prevalent among patients with burn wounds, cystic fibrosis, acute leukemia, organ transplants, and intravenous-drug addiction. P. aeruginosa is a common nosocomial contaminant, and epidemics have been traced to many items in the hospital environment. Patients who are hospitalized for extended periods are frequently colonized by this organism and are at increased risk of developing infection. The most serious infections include malignant external otitis, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemia. The likelihood of recovery from pseudomonas infection is related to the severity of the patient's underlying disease process. The introduction of the antipseudomonal aminoglycosides and penicillins has improved substantially the prognosis of these infections. Ticarcillin and carbenicillin have been especially beneficial in neutropenic patients; however, prompt institution of therapy is mandatory for optimal benefit. Many new drugs with antipseudomonal activity, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and other beta-lactams, have been introduced in recent years and offer the potential for new approaches to therapy for these infections.},

abstract = {Although cell density-dependent regulation of the luminescence genes in Vibrio fischeri is a model for quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria, relatively little is known about the promoter of the luminescence operon. The luminescence operon is activated by the LuxR protein, which requires a diffusible acylhomoserine lactone signal. The lux box, a 20 bp inverted repeat, is located in the luxl promoter region and is required for LuxR-dependent induction of the luminescence genes. Using primer extension, we mapped the LuxR-dependent transcriptional start site of the lux operon to 19 bp upstream of the luxl start codon. This indicates that the lux box is centred at -42.5 bp from the start of transcription. To gain evidence about the location of the -10 sequence, we placed a consensus -35 hexamer at different locations relative to the luxl transcriptional start site and measured constitutive levels of luminescence in recombinant Escherichia coli. The strongest constitutive promoter contained a TATAGT hexamer 17 bp from the -35 consensus sequence and 6 bp from the transcriptional start site. We propose that this is the -10 hexamer. Also in recombinant E. coli, both half-sites of the lux box were required for LuxR-dependent gene activation and for activation by an autoinducer-independent, monomeric LuxR deletion protein. LuxR-dependent activation of luminescence was eliminated when the lux box was centred at -47.5, -52.5 and -62.5 with respect to the luxl transcriptional start site. Our evidence, taken together with other information, points to a model in which a LuxR dimer overlaps the -35 region of the luxl promoter and functions as an ambidextrous activator with each LuxR subunit interacting with a different region of RNA polymerase.},

They can form an amorphous layer of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) surrounding the cell that may be further organized into a distinct structure termed a capsule. Additional polysaccharide molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipooligosaccharide (LOS) may also decorate the cell surface. Polysaccharide capsules may mediate a number of biological processes, including invasive infections of human beings. Discussed here are the genetics and biochemistry of selected bacterial capsular polysaccharides and the basis of capsule diversity but not the genetics and biochemistry of LPS biosynthesis (for reviews see 100, 140).},

abstract = {Bacterial quorum sensing using acyl-homoserine lactones (acyl-HSLs) as cell-density dependent signalling molecules is important for the transcriptional regulation of many genes essential in the establishment and the maintenance of bacteria-host associations. Vibrio fischeri, the symbiotic partner of the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes, possesses two distinct acyl-HSL synthase proteins, LuxI and AinS. Whereas the cell density-dependent regulation of luminescence by the LuxI-produced signal is a well-described phenomenon, and its role in light organ symbiosis has been defined, little is known about the ain system. We have investigated the impact of the V. fischeri acyl-HSL synthase AinS on both luminescence and symbiotic colonization. Through phenotypic studies of V. fischeri mutants we have found that the AinS-signal is the predominant inducer of luminescence expression in culture, whereas the impact of the LuxI-signal is apparent only at the high cell densities occurring in symbiosis. Furthermore, our studies revealed that ainS regulates activities essential for successful colonization of E. scolopes, i.e. the V. fischeri ainS mutant failed to persist in the squid light organ. Mutational inactivation of the transcriptional regulator protein LuxO in the ainS mutant partially or completely reversed all the observed phenotypes, demonstrating that the AinS-signal regulates expression of downstream genes through the inactivation of LuxO. Taken together, our results suggest that the two quorum-sensing systems in V. fischeri, ain and lux, sequentially induce the expression of luminescence genes and possibly other colonization factors.},

abstract = {Cefiderocol is a novel parenteral siderophore cephalosporin that shows potent efficacy against various Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant strains, in vitro and in preclinical models of infection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of cefiderocol after both single and multiple dosing by intravenous infusion over 60 min in healthy adult subjects. A single-ascending-dose study at doses of 100, 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg was conducted in 40 healthy Japanese males and females (6 individuals receiving the active drug and 2 individuals receiving a placebo per cohort). A multiple-ascending-dose study at doses of 1,000 (two groups) and 2,000 mg every 8 h (q8h) was conducted in 30 healthy Japanese and Caucasian males (8 individuals receiving the active drug and 2 individuals receiving a placebo per cohort). There were no serious or clinically significant adverse events (AEs) observed in either study. A single subject receiving 1,000 mg cefiderocol q8h was withdrawn due to AEs. Dose-proportional increases in the maximum plasma concentration ( C max ), the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration after dosing, and the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated from time zero to infinity were observed across the dose range of 100 to 2,000 mg. The mean plasma half-life of cefiderocol was 1.98 to 2.74 h. Cefiderocol was primarily excreted unchanged in the urine (61.5% to 68.4% of the dose). There was little accumulation of C max and AUC by dosing q8h, and the PK of cefiderocol did not change with multiple dosing. This study indicates that single and multiple intravenous doses of cefiderocol at up to 2,000 mg are well tolerated in healthy subjects and exhibit linear PK at doses up to 2,000 mg.},

abstract = {The mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent symbiont Vibrio fischeri has been used extensively as a model system for studies ranging from co-speciation and biogeography to gene regulation and the evolution of pathogenesis. In this association, the luminescent bacterium V. fischeri is housed in a complex light organ within the mantle cavity of E. scolopes. Prior hypotheses have assumed that sepiolid squids in general utilize the bioluminescence produced by their V. fischeri symbionts for counterillumination, a behavior that helps squid camouflage themselves by matching down-welling moonlight via silhouette reduction. This assumption, based solely on the morphology of the squid light organ, has never been empirically tested for Euprymna in the laboratory. Here, we present data demonstrating that E. scolopes can modify the intensity of light produced by V. fischeri in the light organ as down-welling light intensity changes. Bacterial bioluminescence from the light organ is directly correlated with down-welling light intensity, suggesting that E. scolopes individuals utilize and control V. fischeri luminescence for counterillumination. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Sodium triacetoxyborohydride is presented as a general reducing agent for the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones. Procedures for using this mild and selective reagent have been developed for a wide variety of substrates. The scope of the reaction includes aliphatic acyclic and cyclic ketones, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, and primary and secondary amines including a variety of weakly basic and nonbasic amines. Limitations include reactions with aromatic and unsaturated ketones and some sterically hindered ketones and amines. 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE) is the preferred reaction solvent, but reactions can also be carried out in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and occasionally in acetonitrile. Acetic acid may be used as catalyst with ketone reactions, but it is generally not needed with aldehydes. The procedure is carried out effectively in the presence of acid sensitive functional groups such as acetals and ketals; it can also be carried out in the presence of reducible functional groups such as C-C multiple bonds and cyano and nitro groups. Reactions are generally faster in DCE than in THF, and in both solvents, reactions are faster in the presence of AcOH. In comparison with other reductive amination procedures such as NaBH(3)CN/MeOH, borane-pyridine, and catalytic hydrogenation, NaBH(OAc)(3) gave consistently higher yields and fewer side products. In the reductive amination of some aldehydes with primary amines where dialkylation is a problem we adopted a stepwise procedure involving imine formation in MeOH followed by reduction with NaBH(4).},

abstract = {The outer membrane permeability barrier is an important resistance factor of bacterial pathogens. In combination with drug inactivating enzymes, target alteration and efflux, it can increase resistance dramatically. A strategy to overcome this membrane-mediated resistance is the misuse of bacterial transport systems. Most promising are those for iron transport. They are vital for virulence and survival of bacteria in the infected host, where iron depletion is a defense mechanism against invading pathogens. We synthesized biomimetic siderophores as shuttle vectors for active transport of antibiotics through the bacterial membrane. Structure activity relationship studies resulted in siderophore aminopenicillin conjugates that were highly active against Gram-negative pathogens which play a crucial role in destructive lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients and in severe nosocomial infections. The mechanism of action and the uptake of the compounds via specific iron siderophore transport routes were demonstrated. The novel conjugates were active against systemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice with ED(50) values comparable to the quinolone ofloxacin and show low toxicity.},

abstract = {The quorum sensing (QS) signalling system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls many important functions, including virulence. Although the production of the QS signal molecule N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC(12)-HSL) is positively autoregulated, its concentration reaches a steady level long before stationary phase. The RsaL protein represses transcription of the lasI signal synthase gene, and thus reduces QS signal production. We show that RsaL binds simultaneously with LasR to the rsaL-lasI bidirectional promoter thereby preventing the LasR-dependent activation of both genes. In an rsaL mutant, 3OC(12)-HSL production continues to increase throughout growth. Thus RsaL provides homeostasis by functioning in opposition to LasR and limiting 3OC(12)-HSL production to a physiological concentration. Furthermore, transcription profiling revealed that RsaL regulates 130 genes independent of its effect on QS signal molecule production, including genes involved in virulence. We show that RsaL can repress pyocyanin and hydrogen cyanide virulence genes in two ways: directly, by binding to their promoters, and indirectly, by decreasing levels of the signals for their QS signal-dependent transcription. These investigations highlight the importance of RsaL as a global regulator of P. aeruginosa physiology that provides a counterbalance to 3OC(12)-HSL-dependent gene activation via multiple mechanisms.},

abstract = {The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a large array of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs). These compounds were analyzed by LC/MS, using positive electrospray ionization, in the culture supernatant of strain PA14. Fifty-six HAQs and related compounds were detected and their [M + H]+ions were further analyzed by collision induced dissociation (CID). These HAQs were grouped into five different series based on the presence of an hydrogen or hydroxyl group at the 3 position, an N-oxide group in place of the quinoline nitrogen, and an unsaturation on their alkyl side chain. Two new analogs of 3,4-dihydroxy-2 heptylquinoline, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), were found with an alkyl chain longer by one and two methylene groups. Moreover, two additional series of compounds were identified in which a saturated or unsaturated alkyl side chain is located at the 3 position along with an hydroxyl group at the 3 position and a ketone at the 2 position. No HAQ N-oxides, nor any compounds from the latter two series, were detected in a pqsL mutant derivative of PA14, indicating that this gene is involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. This work demonstrates the large repertoire of HAQ and HAQ-related compounds produced by P. aeruginosa, and provides insight into N-oxides biosynthesis and confirm the hypothesis that N-oxides are the precursors of compounds from Series 6 and 7. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

abstract = {We have previously described the design and development of CI-988, a peptoid analogue of CCK-4 with excellent binding affinity and selectivity for the CCK-B receptor. Due to its anxiolytic profile in animal models of anxiety, this compound was developed as a clinical candidate. However, during its development, it was determined that CI-988 had low bioavailability in both rodent and nonrodent species. In the clinic, it was further established that CI-988 had poor bioavailability. Thus, there was a need to identify an analogue with an improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The poor bioavailability was attributed to poor absorption and efficient hepatic extraction. We envisaged that reducing the molecular weight of the parent compound (5, MW = 614) would lead to better absorption. Thus, we synthesized a series of analogues in which the key alpha-methyltryptophan and adamantyloxycarbonyl moieties, required for receptor binding, were kept intact and the C-terminus was extensively modified. This SAR study led to the identification of tricyclo[3.3.1.1(3,7)]dec-2-yl [1S-[1 alpha(S*)2 beta]-[2-[(2-hydroxycyclohexyl)amino]-1-(1H-indol-3- ylmethyl)-1-methyl-2-oxoethyl]carbamate (CI-1015, 31) with binding affinities of 3.0 and 2900 nM for the CCK-B and CCK-A receptors, respectively. The compound showed CCK-B antagonist profile in the rat ventromedial hypothalamus assay with a Ke of 34 nM. It also showed an anxiolytic like profile orally in a standard anxiety paradigm (X-maze) with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 0.1 microgram/kg. Although the compound is less water soluble than CI-988, oral bioavailability in rat was improved nearly 10 times relative to CI-988 when dosed in HP beta CD. The blood-brain permeability of CI-1015 (31) was also enhanced relative to CI-988 (5). On the basis of the overall improved pharmacokinetic profile as well as enhanced brain penetration, CI-1015 (31) was chosen as a development candidate.},

abstract = {Vibrio fischeri is found both as a free-living bacterium in seawater and as the specific, mutualistic light organ symbiont of several fish and squid species. To identify those characteristics of symbiosis-competent strains that are required for successful colonization of the nascent light organ of juvenile Euprymna scolopes squids, we generated a mutant pool by using the transposon Mu dI 1681 and screened this pool for strains that were no longer motile. Eighteen independently isolated nonmotile mutants that were either flagellated or nonflagellated were obtained. In contrast to the parent strain, none of these nonmotile mutants was able to colonize the juvenile squid light organ. The flagellated nonmotile mutant strain NM200 possessed a bundle of sheathed polar flagella indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain, indicating that the presence of flagella alone is not sufficient for colonization and that it is motility itself that is required for successful light organ colonization. This study identifies motility as the first required symbiotic phenotype of V. fischeri.},

abstract = {The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses intercellular signals to control the density-dependent expression of many virulence factors. The las and rhl quorum-sensing systems function, respectively, through the autoinducers N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C(4)-HSL), which are known to positively regulate the transcription of the elastase-encoding gene, lasB. Recently, we reported that a second type of intercellular signal is involved in lasB induction. This signal was identified as 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone and designated the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). PQS was determined to be part of the quorum-sensing hierarchy since its production and bioactivity depended on the las and rhl quorum-sensing systems, respectively. In order to define the role of PQS in the P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing cascade, lacZ gene fusions were used to determine the effect of PQS on the transcription of the quorum-sensing system genes lasR, lasI, rhlR, and rhlI. We found that in P. aeruginosa, PQS caused a major induction of rhlI'-lacZ and had lesser effects on the transcription of lasR'-lacZ and rhlR'-lacZ. We also observed that the transcription of both rhlI'-lacZ and lasB'-lacZ was cooperatively effected by C(4)-HSL and PQS. Additionally, we present data indicating that PQS was not produced maximally until cultures reached the late stationary phase of growth. Taken together, our results imply that PQS acts as a link between the las and rhl quorum-sensing systems and that this signal is not involved in sensing cell density.},

abstract = {Determination of the MIC, based on the activities of antibiotics against planktonic bacteria, is the standard assay for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Adherent bacterial populations (biofilms) present with an innate lack of antibiotic susceptibility not seen in the same bacteria grown as planktonic populations. The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) is described as a new technology for the rapid and reproducible assay of biofilm susceptibilities to antibiotics. The CBD produces 96 equivalent biofilms for the assay of antibiotic susceptibilities by the standard 96-well technology. Biofilm formation was followed by quantitative microbiology and scanning electron microscopy. Susceptibility to a standard group of antibiotics was determined for National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. Growth curves demonstrated that biofilms of a predetermined size could be formed on the CBD at specific time points and, furthermore, that no significant difference (P > 0.1) was seen between biofilms formed on each of the 96 pegs. The antibiotic susceptibilities for planktonic populations obtained by the NCCLS method or from the CBD were similar. Minimal biofilm eradication concentrations, derived by using the CBD, demonstrated that for biofilms of the same organisms, 100 to 1,000 times the concentration of a certain antibiotic were often required for the antibiotic to be effective, while other antibiotics were found to be effective at the MICs. The CBD offers a new technology for the rational selection of antibiotics effective against microbial biofilms and for the screening of new effective antibiotic compounds.},

abstract = {A series of structural analogs of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa autoinducer [PAI, N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone] were obtained and tested for their ability to act as autoinducers in stimulating the expression of the gene for elastase (lasB) by measuring beta-galactosidase production from a lasB-lacZ gene fusion in the presence of the transcriptional activator LasR. The data suggest that the length of the acyl side chain of the autoinducer molecule is the most critical factor for activity. Replacement of the ring O by S in the homoserine lactone moiety can be tolerated. Tritium-labelled PAI ([3H]PAI) was synthesized and used to demonstrate the association of [3H]PAI with cells overexpressing LasR. The PAI analogs were also tested for their ability to compete with [3H]PAI for binding of LasR. Results from the competition assays suggest that once again the length of the acyl side chain appears to be crucial for antagonist activity. The presence of the 3-oxo moiety also plays a significant role in binding since analogs which lacked this moiety were much less effective in blocking binding of [3H]PAI. All analogs demonstrating competition with PAI in binding to LasR also exhibited the ability to activate lasB expression, suggesting that they are functional analogs of PAI.},

abstract = {Ciprofloxacin accumulation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was measured by a bioassay. Drug accumulation in strain PAO2 was compared with that of three spontaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants selected with 0.5 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. PAO4701 cfxA2 contains a mutation in the gyrA gene, PAO4742 cfxB5 may represent a permeability mutant based on pleiotropic drug resistance, and PAO4700 cfxA1 cfxB1 contains both types of mutations. In all strains, drug accumulation was similar, reaching steady state during the first minute of exposure. Drug accumulation was unsaturable over a range of 5 to 80 micrograms/ml, suggesting that ciprofloxacin accumulates by diffusion in P. aeruginosa. Although all four strains accumulated two- to sevenfold more ciprofloxacin in the presence of the inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the cfxB mutants accumulated two- to fourfold less drug than either PAO2 or the cfxA2 mutant. Polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed a protein common to cfxB mutants only, while all strains had similar lipopolysaccharide profiles. The results suggest that ciprofloxacin accumulation in P. aeruginosa is a complex phenomenon that may be affected by both an energy-dependent drug efflux process and outer envelope composition.},

abstract = {One of the best-documented aspects of the biology of lumi- nous bacteria has been their abundance and distribution in the marine environment (reviewed in reference 51). This has re- sulted in part from the relative ease of studying these micro- organisms; the bioluminescence produced by most of the col- onies formed by this group of bacteria makes them readily recognizable upon primary isolation, and a robust and simple phenotype-based taxonomy is available for species-level iden- tification (66). Past studies have demonstrated that marine luminous bacteria, and Vibrio fischeri in particular, are remark- ably successful at adapting to a variety of ecological niches (50). They are commonly present as planktonic cells in seawa- ter or sediments (59, 63, 70, 74), and as saprophytes they populate fecal material and the surfaces of dead or dying marine animals (1, 8, 37). V. fischeri and other luminous bac- teria also form a variety of pathogenic and cooperative asso- ciations with marine animals: they are increasingly recognized as causes of invertebrate diseases (2, 22, 38, 77); they are a common constituent of enteric tract microbial consortia (60, 64, 72); and they encompass the four described species (V. fis- cheri, Vibrio logei, Photobacterium phosphoreum, and Photobac- terium leiognathi) that form stable, cooperative associations in specialized symbiotic organs of marine squids and fishes (18, 51). Although many studies have reported specific niches and predictable patterns in geographical distribution for luminous bacterial species (17, 50, 59), the factors underlying their eco- logical dynamics (e.g., their movement between niches and their formation of stable subspecies or biovars) have, until re- cently, been poorly understood. We discuss here what is cur- rently known about the extent to which the population of planktonic V. fischeri can influence, or be influenced by, its ex- istence in symbiotic niches (24, 50).},

abstract = {Bacteria sense their environment using receptors of the histidine sensor kinase family, but how kinase activity is regulated by ligand binding is not well understood. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a secreted signaling molecule originally identified in studies of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi, regulates quorum-sensing responses and allows communication between different bacterial species. AI-2 signal transduction in V. harveyi requires the integral membrane receptor LuxPQ, comprised of periplasmic binding protein (LuxP) and histidine sensor kinase (LuxQ) subunits. Combined X-ray crystallographic and functional studies show that AI-2 binding causes a major conformational change within LuxP, which in turn stabilizes a quaternary arrangement in which two LuxPQ monomers are asymmetrically associated. We propose that formation of this asymmetric quaternary structure is responsible for repressing the kinase activity of both LuxQ subunits and triggering the transition of V. harveyi into quorum-sensing mode. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Herein we describe the sequential synthesis of a variety of azide-alkyne click chemistry-compatible heterobifunctional oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkers for bioconjugation chemistry applications. Synthesis of these bioorthogonal linkers was accomplished through desymmetrization of OEGs by conversion of one of the hydroxyl groups to either an alkyne or azido functionality. The remaining distal hydroxyl group on the OEGs was activated by either a 4-nitrophenyl carbonate or a mesylate (-OMs) group. The -OMs functional group served as a useful precursor to form a variety of heterobifunctionalized OEG linkers containing different highly reactive end groups, e.g., iodo, -NH(2), -SH and maleimido, that were orthogonal to the alkyne or azido functional group. Also, the alkyne- and azide-terminated OEGs are useful for generating larger discrete poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) linkers (e.g., PEG(16) and PEG(24)) by employing a Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition click reaction. The utility of these clickable heterobifunctional OEGs in bioconjugation chemistry was demonstrated by attachment of the integrin ($\alpha$(v)$\beta$(3)) receptor targeting peptide, cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys) (cRGfKD) and to the fluorescent probe sulfo-rhodamine B. The synthetic methodology presented herein is suitable for the large scale production of several novel heterobifunctionalized OEGs from readily available and inexpensive starting materials.},

abstract = {Salmycin A–D, Antibiotics from Strep tomy ces violaceus, DSM 8286, Having a Siderophor-Aminoglycoside Structure Salmycin B (2) and C (3) were isolated under acid conditions, under which they are stable, from the culture broth of Streptomyces violaceus, DSM 8286. The acid- and alkaline-labile, native main component salmycin A (1), as well as salmycin D (4), were obtained under strictly neutral pH conditions. The compounds 1 (C41H70FeN7O21), 2 (C41H69FeN6O21), 3 (C40H67FeN6O21), and 4 (C40H68FeN7O21) are classified as sideromycins and are stable when dry. Mild alkaline hydrolysis of 1 and 2 yielded the known siderophor danoxamin (5; C27H46FeN5O11), and amino-disaccharides. The amino-glycoside 6 (C14H25NO11) of salmycin B was stabilized by hydrogenation and the structure of the corresponding peracetate 10 determined by 1H,1H- and 1H,13C-correlation NMR spectroscopy (Table 1). Compound 6 consists of a glucos-2-ulose unit which is linked to the 2-position of a 6-deoxy-6-(methylamino)heptopyranose. The danoxamin is bonded via the carboxy group by ester linkage to the primary alcohol of the glucos-2-ulose. Salmycin A (1) is a natural oxime of 2, it was synthesized from 2 with hydroxylamine. The salmycins and those derivatives which contain hexapyranos-2-ulose form stable ketone hydrates which can be identified by mass spectrometry. Although several recently identified features of the danomycins do not correspond with those of the salmycins, 13C-NMR spectra show that both groups of antibiotics are closely related. All salmycins, especially component 1, are highly active against Staphylococci and Streptococci, even against resistant strains of these pathogens.},

Some appeared to bind with an affinity similar to that of the autoinducer, but none showed a higher affinity, and many did not bind as tightly as the autoinducer. For the most part, compounds with substitutions in the homoserine lactone ring did not show evidence of binding to LuxR. The exceptions were compounds with a homocysteine thiolactone ring in place of the homoserine lactone ring. Many but not all of the analogs showing evidence of LuxR binding had some ability to activate the luminescence genes. None were as active as the autoinducer. While most showed little ability to induce luminescence, a few analogs with rather conservative substitutions had appreciable activity. Under the conditions we employed, some of the analogs showing little or no ability to induce luminescence were inhibitors of the autoinducer.},

A 19F NMR study was used to determine the hydrolytic stability of conjugate 9 under assay conditions. Preliminary biological studies with ferric complexes of conjugates 9 and 12 indicated that these antifungal agents are recognized by Candida and perhaps are actively transported into the cell by the siderophore-transport mechanisms. While conjugate 18 did not show any significant antibacterial activity, presumably due to size restriction, the 5-FU conjugate 9 appeared to be moderately active against a variety of Gram-positive strains, and was more active than the 5-FC control against some strains of Staphylococcus.},

abstract = {Penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) of Staphylococcus aureus is refractory to inhibition by available beta-lactam antibiotics, resulting in resistance to these antibiotics. The strains of S. aureus that have acquired the mecA gene for PBP2a are designated as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The mecA gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and PBP2a was purified to homogeneity. The kinetic parameters for interactions of several beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and a carbapenem) and PBP2a were evaluated. The enzyme manifests resistance to covalent modification by beta-lactam antibiotics at the active site serine residue in two ways. First, the microscopic rate constant for acylation (k2) is attenuated by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude over the corresponding determinations for penicillin-sensitive penicillin-binding proteins. Second, the enzyme shows elevated dissociation constants (Kd) for the non-covalent pre-acylation complexes with the antibiotics, the formation of which ultimately would lead to enzyme acylation. The two factors working in concert effectively prevent enzyme acylation by the antibiotics in vivo, giving rise to drug resistance. Given the opportunity to form the acyl enzyme species in in vitro experiments, circular dichroism measurements revealed that the enzyme undergoes substantial conformational changes in the course of the process that would lead to enzyme acylation. The observed conformational changes are likely to be a hallmark for how this enzyme carries out its catalytic function in cross-linking the bacterial cell wall.},

abstract = {Animals are typically colonized by diverse bacterial symbionts, many of which are commensal and, in numerous cases, even essential for their host's proper development and growth. In exchange, the host must supply a sufficient array and quantity of nutrients to support the proliferation and persistence of its microbial community. In this investigation, we have examined such a nutritional environment by determining the symbiotic competence of auxotrophic mutants of the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri, and have demonstrated that the host squid Euprymna scolopes provides at least 9 aa to the growing culture of symbiotic V. fischeri present in its light-emitting organ. We also collected and analyzed the extracellular fluid from this organ, in which the symbionts reside, and confirmed that it contained significant amounts of amino acids. The combined results suggested that host-derived free amino acids, as well as peptides or proteins, are a source of the amino acids that support the growth of the symbionts. This work describes a technique to sample the symbionts and their surrounding environment without contamination by host tissue components and, in combination with molecular genetic studies, allows the characterization of the nutritional conditions that support a cooperative animal-bacterial symbiosis.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), a quorum-sensing (QS) signal that regulates numerous virulence genes including those involved in iron scavenging. Biophysical analysis revealed that 2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolones form complexes with iron(III) at physiological pH. The overall stability constant of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone iron(III) complex was log $\beta$3 = 36.2 with a pFe3+ value of 16.6 at pH 7.4. PQS was found to operate via at least three distinct signaling pathways, and its precursor, 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), which does not form an iron complex, was discovered to function as an autoinducer molecule per se. When PQS was supplied to a P. aeruginosa mutant unable to make pyoverdine or pyochelin, PQS associated with the cell envelope and inhibited bacterial growth, a finding that reveals a secondary function for PQS in iron entrapment to facilitate siderophore-mediated iron delivery. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A set of 30 mutants exhibiting reduced production of the phenazine poison pyocyanin were isolated following transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The mutants could be subdivided into those with defects in the primary phenazine biosynthetic pathway and those with more pleiotropic defects. The largest set of pleiotropic mutations blocked the production of the extracellular Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), a molecule required for the synthesis of secondary metabolites and extracellular enzymes. Most of these pqs mutations affected genes which appear to encode PQS biosynthetic functions, although a transcriptional regulator and an apparent response effector were also represented. Two of the genes required for PQS synthesis (phnA and phnB) had previously been assumed to encode phenazine biosynthetic functions. The transcription of one of the genes required for PQS synthesis (PA2587/pqsH) was regulated by the LasI/R quorum-sensing system, thereby linking quorum sensing and PQS regulation. Others of the pleiotropic phenazine-minus mutations appear to inactivate novel components of the quorum-sensing regulatory network, including one regulator (np20) previously shown to be required for virulence in neutropenic mice.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence in the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri is controlled by the excretion of a N-acyl homoserine lactone (HSL) autoinducer which interacts with a regulator, LuxR, and activates transcription of the lux operon at high-cell density. This system has become the prototype for quorum sensing in many bacteria. Although light emission in Vibrio harveyi is also regulated by a N-acyl-HSL inducer, in sharp contrast, a completely different and more complex system is involved in quorum sensing which is mediated via LuxO, the response regulator of a phosphorelay signal transduction system. In the present work, luxO and the overlapping luxU gene, also involved in the phosphorelay system in V. harveyi, have been discovered in V. fischeri. By gene replacement technology, a V. fischeri luxO- mutant was generated whose phenotype was similar to that of V. harveyi luxO- showing that LuxO is involved in control of luminescence in V. fischeri. This mutant could be complemented with luxO from either V. fischeri or V. harveyi resulting in the restoration of the dependence of luminescence intensity on cell density. In contrast to V. harveyi luxO-, light emission of V. fischeri luxO- was stimulated by the N-acyl-HSL autoinducer indicating that luxO is part of a second signal transduction system controlling luminescence in this species. The presence of a luxO-based phosphorelay regulatory system as well as the luxR-based system in V. fischeri suggests that the former system, originally discovered in V. harveyi, may be a general regulatory mechanism in luminescent bacteria.},

abstract = {During the process of exploring aqueous piperazine chemistry under simulated flue-gas scrubbing conditions, positive-ion electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) analyses of the resulting reaction mixtures in a triple quadrupole system revealed the presence of peaks at m/z 116 and 145, the putative N-nitroso derivatives of piperazine. Confirmation of the presence of these species in the reaction mixtures was achieved using collision-induced dissociation experiments. A purchased standard, together with in-house synthesised N-nitrosopiperazine standards (including N-nitroso derivatives derived from deuterium-labelled precursor materials), were used for this purpose. Across a small range of collision energies, large fluctuations in the abundance of the two major product ions of protonated N-nitrosopiperazine, m/z 86 and 85, were observed. Using B3LYP/6-311 + +G(d,p) computations, the potential energy surface was determined for loss of NO and [H,N,O]. At an activation energy slightly in excess of 1 eV, intramolecular isomerisation precedes loss of NO (m/z 86) via a 4,1 H-shift, and at activation energies between 2.1-2.3 eV, consecutive loss of NO and atomic hydrogen competes with the direct loss of nitrosyl hydride (m/z 85). It is recommended that any multiple reaction monitoring method for quantifying N-nitrosopiperazines at low collision energies use the sum of both transitions (m/z 116 ← 85, m/z 116 ← 86) to avoid errors that could be introduced by subtle changes in ES source conditions or collision voltages. This approach is adopted in an HPLC/MS/MS method used to monitor the degradation of N-nitrosopiperazine exposed to (i) broad-band UV light and (ii) heat typical of an amine regeneration (stripper) tower. The results reveal that aqueous N-nitrosopiperazine is thermally stable at 150°C but will degrade slowly upon exposure to UV light.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing is an intercellular form of communication that bacteria use \r\nto coordinate group behaviors such as biofilm formation and the production of antibiotics \r\nand virulence factors. The term quorum sensing was originally coined to describe the mechanism underlying the onset of luminescence production in cultures of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Luminescence and, more generally, quorum sensing are important for V. fischeri to form a mutualistic symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. The symbiosis is established when V. fischeri cells migrate via flagella-based motility from the surrounding seawater into a specialized structure injuvenile squid called the light organ. The cells grow to high cell densities within the light organ where the infection persists over the lifetime of the animal. A hallmark of a successful symbiosis is the luminescence produced by V. fischeri that camouflages the squid at night by eliminating its shadow within the water column. While the regulatory networks governing quorum sensing are critical for properly regulating V. fischeri luminescence within the squid light organ, they also regulate luminescence-independent processes during symbiosis. In this review, we discuss the quorum-sensing network of \r\nV. fischeri and highlight its impact at various stages during host colonization.},

abstract = {In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the production of many virulence factors and secondary metabolites is regulated in concert with cell density through quorum sensing. Two quorum-sensing regulons have been identified in which the LuxR homologues LasR and RhlR are activated by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) respectively. The lasR and rhlR genes are linked to the luxl homologues lasl and rhll, which are responsible for synthesis of OdDHL and BHL, respectively. As lasRl and rhlRl are both involved in regulating synthesis of exoenzymes such as elastase, we sought to determine the nature of their interrelationship. By using lacZ transcriptional fusions in both homologous (P. aeruginosa) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) genetic backgrounds we provide evidence that (i) lasR is expressed constitutively throughout the growth cycle, (ii) rhlR expression is regulated by LasR/OdDHL, and (iii) that RhlR/BHL regulates rhll. We also show that expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor gene rpoS is abolished in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant and in the pleiotropic BHL-negative mutant PANO67. Furthermore, our data reveal that kin E. coli, an rpoS-lacZ fusion is regulated directly by RhlR/BHL. Taken together, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa employs a multilayered hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving RhlR/BHL and LasR/OdDHL, interlinked via RpoS, to integrate the regulation of virulence determinants and secondary metabolites with adaptation and survival in the stationary phase.},

The compounds displayed good to excellent inhibition of the growth of the mycobacterial test strains with improved antimycobacterial activity compared to the hit compound, evocarpine. The most active compounds, which possessed chain length of 11-13 carbons at position-2 displayed potent inhibitory effects with an MIC value of 1.0mg/L. In a human diploid embryonic lung cell line, MRC-5 cytotoxicity assay, the alkaloids showed weak to moderate cytotoxic activity. Biological evaluation of these evocarpine analogues on the less pathogenic fast growing strains of mycobacteria showed an interesting antimycobacterial profile and provided significant insight into the structure-activity relationships.},

abstract = {The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), and its precursor 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), play a key role in coordinating virulence in the important cystic fibrosis pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The discovery of HHQ analogues in Burkholderia and other microorganisms led us to investigate the possibility that these compounds can influence interspecies behaviour. We found that surface-associated phenotypes were repressed in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in pathogenic yeast in response to PQS and HHQ. Motility was repressed in a broad range of bacteria, while biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans was repressed in the presence of HHQ, though initial adhesion was unaffected. Furthermore, HHQ exhibited potent bacteriostatic activity against several Gram-negative bacteria, including pathogenic Vibrio vulnificus. Structure-function analysis using synthetic analogues provided an insight into the molecular properties that underpin the ability of these compounds to influence microbial behaviour, revealing the alkyl chain to be fundamental. Defining the influence of these molecules on microbial-eukaryotic-host interactions will facilitate future therapeutic strategies which seek to combat microorganisms that are recalcitrant to conventional antimicrobial agents.},

QS modulators are effective at attenuating P. aeruginosa virulence; therefore, they are a potential new class of antibacterial agent. The lactone in BHL and OdDHL is hydrolysed under physiological conditions. The hydrolysis proceeds at a rate faster than racemisation of the alpha-chiral centre. Non-hydrolysable, non-racemic analogues (small molecule probes) were designed and synthesised, replacing the lactone with a ketone. OdDHL analogues were found to be relatively unstable to decomposition unless they were difluorinated between the beta-keto amide. Stability studies on a non-hydrolysable, cyclohexanone analogue indicated that racemisation of the alpha-chiral centre was relatively slow. This analogue was assayed to show that the L-isomer is likely to be responsible for the QS autoinducing activity in P. aeruginosa and Serratia strain ATCC39006.},

abstract = {Kinases present an attractive target for drug development, since they are involved in vital cellular processes and are implicated in a variety of diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. However, obtaining selectivity for a specific kinase over others is difficult since many current kinase inhibitors exclusively target the highly conserved kinase ATP binding domain. Previously, a microarray-based strategy to discover so-called bisubstrate-based inhibitors that target the more specific peptide binding groove in addition to the ATP binding site was described. One attractive feature of this strategy is the opportunity to tune the selectivity of these inhibitors by systematically varying components. In an extension to this previous work, this study explores the potential of this guided selectivity modulation, leading to a series of inhibitors with different selectivity profiles against highly homologous protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. Of the inhibitors studied, most exhibited improved potency and selectivity compared with their constituent parts. Furthermore, the selectivity was found to be tunable either through modification of the pseudosubstrate peptide (peptide binding groove) or the ATP-competitive part (ATP binding site). In a number of cases, the selectivity of the construct could be predicted from the initial peptide substrate profiling experiment. Since this strategy is applicable to all kinase sets, it could be used to rapidly develop uniquely selective inhibitors.},

abstract = {The enzymes for luminescence in Vibrio fischeri are induced only when a sufficient concentration of a metabolic product (autoinducer) specifically produced by this species accumulates. It has previously been shown that the autoinducer is 3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone and that it enters the cells by simple diffusion. To further study the mechanism of induction, we have synthesized several analogs of the autoinducer. The analogs were tested with V. fischeri for their inducing activity and for their ability to inhibit the action of the natural autoinducer. The compounds were found to display various combinations of inducing and inhibiting abilities. None of the compounds tested appeared to have any effect on cells of V. harveyi strain MAV or Photobacterium leiognathi strain 721, but several of the compounds decreased light output by P. phosphoreum strain 8265. These studies show that 1) the site of action of the autoinducer is not highly sterically constrained 2) the autoinducers of other species of luminous bacteria are likely to be quite different from that of V. fischeri and 3) a simple mode in which one autoinducer molecule binds to a single receptor protein site and thus initiates luciferase synthesis is inadequate. The analogs should prove useful in the study of the binding site and mode of action of the autoinducer.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell communication is a major process that allows bacteria to sense and coordinately react to the fluctuating conditions of the surrounding environment. In several pathogens, this process triggers the production of virulence factors and/or a switch in bacterial lifestyle that is a major determining factor in the outcome and severity of the infection. Understanding how bacteria control these signaling systems is crucial to the development of novel antimicrobial agents capable of reducing virulence while allowing the immune system of the host to clear bacterial infection, an approach likely to reduce the selective pressures for development of resistance. We provide here an up-to-date overview of the molecular basis and physiological implications of cell-to-cell signaling systems in Gram-negative bacteria, focusing on the well-studied bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All of the known cell-to-cell signaling systems in this bacterium are described, from the most-studied systems, i.e., N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), the 4-quinolones, the global activator of antibiotic and cyanide synthesis (GAC), the cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) systems, and the alarmones guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp), to less-well-studied signaling molecules, including diketopiperazines, fatty acids (diffusible signal factor [DSF]-like factors), pyoverdine, and pyocyanin. This overview clearly illustrates that bacterial communication is far more complex than initially thought and delivers a clear distinction between signals that are quorum sensing dependent and those relying on alternative factors for their production.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli that carry a recombinant plasmid bearing the Vibrio fischeri lux regulon express luminescence that mimics the luminescence of V. fischeri. The lux regulon consists of two divergently transcribed operons, the rightward operon (luxICDABE genes) and the leftward operon (luxR gene). The luxR and luxI genes and the control region separating the two operons supply the primary regulatory control over the lux regulon; the regulatory mechanisms result in a dramatic increase in the rate of luciferase synthesis after induction, apparently due to a unique autoregulatory positive feedback mechanism, and in an enormous difference (greater than 10^(4) in levels of luminescence in cells before and after induction. The generally accepted model of primary regulation of bioluminescence in V. fischeri involves the interaction of the product of the luxR gene and N-(3-oxohexanoyl)homoserine lactone, the autoinducer produced by the enzyme encoded by luxI, the first gene of the rightward operon, with an operator sequence within the control region to stimulate transcription of the rightward operon in a positive feedback loop. We have used deletion mapping of a transcription reporter vector to determine the approximate location of the operator. By site-directed mutagenesis of the presumed operator, we have demonstrated that the 20-base-pair inverted repeat ACCTGTAGGA/TCGTA CAGGT (where the vertical line is the center of symmetry), which bears striking similarity to the recognition sequence for the pleiotropic repressor protein LexA, is the operator of the lux regulon. We also found that deletion of sequences upstream of the palindrome leads to increased transcription from the rightward promoter (PR), indicative of a cis-acting element that represses transcription in the absence of the LuxR-autoinducer complex. Modifications of the palindrome that eliminate stimulation by LuxR-autoinducer of transcription from PR have no effect on repression by the cis-acting mechanism(s), suggesting that the palindrome is not necessary for repression of the rightward operon. Thus, it appears that the large increase in transcription upon induction of the lux regulon is the result of at least two independent mechanisms, one positive and the other negative.},

abstract = {Bacteria communicate with one another using chemical signal molecules. As in higher organisms, the information supplied by these molecules is critical for synchronizing the activities of large groups of cells. In bacteria, chemical communication involves producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to small hormone-like molecules termed autoinducers . This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to changes in the number and/or species present in a community. Most quorum-sensing-controlled processes are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium acting alone but become beneficial when carried out simultaneously by a large number of cells. Thus, quorum sensing confuses the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes because it enables bacteria to act as multicellular organisms. This review focuses on the architectures of bacterial chemical communication networks; how chemical information is integrated, processed, and transduced to control gene expression; how intra- and interspecies cell-cell communication is accomplished; and the intriguing possibility of prokaryote-eukaryote cross-communication.},

abstract = {The increasing development of bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics has reached alarming levels, thus necessitating a strong need to develop new antimicrobial agents. These new antimicrobials should possess novel modes of action and/or different cellular targets compared with the existing antibiotics. As a result, new classes of compounds designed to avoid defined resistance mechanisms are undergoing pre clinical and clinical evaluation. Microbial and phage genomic sequencing are now being used to find previously unidentified genes and their corresponding proteins. In both traditional and newly developed antibiotics, the target selectivity lies in the drug itself, in its ability to affect a mechanism that is unique to prokaryotes. As a result, a vast number of potent agents that, due to low selectivity, in addition to the pathogen also affect the eukaryote host have been excluded from use as therapeutics. Such compounds could be re-considered for clinical use if applied as part of a targeted delivery platform where the drug selectivity is replaced by target-selectivity borne by the targeting moiety. With a large number of antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates already approved or near approval as cancer therapeutics, targeted therapy is becoming increasingly attractive and additional potential targeting moieties that are non-antibody based, such as peptides, non-antibody ligand-binding proteins and even carbohydrates are receiving increasing attention. Still, targeted therapy is mostly focused on cancer, with targeted anti bacterial therapies being suggested only very recently. This review will focus in the various methods of antimicrobial targeting, by systemic and local application of targeted antimicrobial substances.},

abstract = {The incidence of hospital-acquired infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate. Equally alarming is the overall lack of efficacious therapeutic options for clinicians, which is due primarily to the acquisition and development of various antibiotic resistance mechanisms that render these drugs ineffective. Among these mechanisms is the reduced permeability of the outer membrane, which prevents many marketed antibiotics from traversing this barrier. To circumvent this, recent drug discovery efforts have focused on conjugating a siderophore moiety to a pharmacologically active compound that has been designed to hijack the bacterial siderophore transport system and trick cells into importing the active drug by recognizing it as a nutritionally beneficial compound. MC-1, a novel siderophore-conjugated $\beta$-lactam that promotes its own uptake into bacteria, has exquisite activity against many Gram-negative pathogens. While the inclusion of the siderophore was originally designed to facilitate outer membrane penetration into Gram-negative cells, here we show that this structural moiety also renders other clinically relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms unable to affect MC-1 efficacy. Resistance frequency determinations and subsequent characterization of first-step resistant mutants identified PiuA, a TonB-dependent outer membrane siderophore receptor, as the primary means of MC-1 entry into Pseudomonas aeruginosa . While the MICs of these mutants were increased 32-fold relative to the parental strain in vitro , we show that this resistance phenotype is not relevant in vivo , as alternative siderophore-mediated uptake mechanisms compensated for the loss of PiuA under iron-limiting conditions.},

abstract = {Proteins of the LuxR family detect the presence of N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and regulate transcription accordingly. When AHLs are synthesized by the same species that detects them, the system allows a bacterium to measure the population density of its own species, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. The sdiA genes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are predicted to encode LuxR homologs. However, these species do not appear to synthesize AHLs or any other molecule detected by SdiA. It has previously been demonstrated that overexpression of sdiA results in the activation of the ftsQAZ locus in E. coli and four other loci in Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. Here we report that transcriptional fusions to these five loci fall into two classes. The first class requires overexpression of sdiA for activation. The second class responds to sdiA expressed from its natural position in the chromosome if the appropriate AHLs are added to the culture. The only member of the second class is a series of Prck-luxCDABE fusions in Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. SdiA responds with highest sensitivity to AHLs that have a keto modification at the third carbon and an acyl chain length of 6 or 8 (half-maximal response between 1 and 5 nM). Growth of Salmonella in proximity to species known to synthesize these AHLs results in sdiA-dependent activation of the Prck-luxCDABE fusions. SdiA appears to be the first AHL receptor discovered that detects signals emanating exclusively from other species.},

@article{Shadel1991,
abstract = {Regulation of the genes required for bioluminescence in the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri (the lux regulon) is a complex process requiring coordination of several systems. The primary level of regulation is mediated by a positive regulatory protein, LuxR, and a small diffusible molecule, N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-homoserine lactone, termed autoinducer. Transcription of the luxR gene, which encodes the regulatory protein, is positively regulated by the cyclic AMP-CAP system. The lux regulon of V. fischeri consists of two divergently transcribed operons designated operonL and operonR. Transcription of the rightward operon (operonR; luxICDABE), consisting of the genes required for autoinducer synthesis (luxI) and light production (luxCDABE), is activated by LuxR in an autoinducer-dependent fashion. The leftward operon (operonL) consists of a single known gene, luxR. The LuxR protein has also been shown to decrease transcription of operonL through an autoinducer-dependent mechanism, thereby negatively regulating its own synthesis. In this paper we demonstrate that the autoinducer-dependent repression of operonL transcription requires not only LuxR but also DNA sequences within operonR which occur upstream of the promoter for operonL. In the absence of these DNA sequences, the LuxR protein causes an autoinducer-dependent activation of transcription of operonL. The lux operator, located in the control region between the two operons, was required for both the positive and negative autoinducer-dependent responses. By titration of high levels of LuxR supplied in trans with synthetic autoinducer, we found that low levels of autoinducer could elicit a positive response even in the presence of the negative-acting DNA sequences, while higher levels of autoinducer resulted in a negative response. Without these DNA sequences in operonR, LuxR and autoinducer stimulated transcription regardless of the level of autoinducer. These results suggest that a switch between stimulation and repression of operonL transcription is mediated by the levels of the LuxR-autoinducer complex, which in these experiments reflects the level of autoinducer in the growth medium.},

The formation of homoserine by hydrolysis of the autoinducer was consistent with this structure.

abstract = {Multiresistance in Gram-negative pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp. and the Enterobacteriaceae, is a significant problem in medicine today. While multiple mechanisms often contribute to multiresistance, a broadly distributed family of three-component multidrug efflux systems is an increasingly recognised determinant of both intrinsic and acquired multiresistance in these organisms. Homologues of these efflux systems are also readily identifiable in the genome sequences of a wide range of Gram-negative organisms, pathogens and non-pathogens alike, where they probably promote efflux-mediated resistance to multiple antimicrobials. Significantly, these systems often accommodate biocides, raising the spectre of biocide-mediated selection of multiresistance in Gram-negative pathogens. While there is some debate as to the natural function of these efflux systems, only some of which are inducible by their antimicrobial substrates, their contribution to resistance in a variety of pathogens nonetheless makes them reasonable targets for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, given the incredible chemical diversity of substrates accommodated by these efflux systems, it is likely that many novel or yet to be discovered antimicrobials will themselves be efflux substrates and, as such, efflux inhibitors may become an important component of Gram-negative antimicrobial therapy.},

abstract = {Bacteria frequently manifest distinct phenotypes as a function of cell density in a phenomenon known as quorum sensing (QS). This intercellular signalling process is mediated by "chemical languages" comprised of low-molecular weight signals, known as autoinducers, and their cognate receptor proteins. As many of the phenotypes regulated by QS can have a significant impact on the success of pathogenic or mutualistic prokaryotic-eukaryotic interactions, there is considerable interest in methods to probe and modulate QS pathways with temporal and spatial control. Such methods would be valuable for both basic research in bacterial ecology and in practical medicinal, agricultural, and industrial applications. Toward this goal, considerable recent research has been focused on the development of chemical approaches to study bacterial QS pathways. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the use of chemical probes and techniques in QS research. Specifically, we focus on: (1) combinatorial approaches for the discovery of small molecule QS modulators, (2) affinity chromatography for the isolation of QS receptors, (3) reactive and fluorescent probes for QS receptors, (4) antibodies as quorum "quenchers," (5) abiotic polymeric "sinks" and "pools" for QS signals, and (6) the electrochemical sensing of QS signals. The application of such chemical methods can offer unique advantages for both elucidating and manipulating QS pathways in culture and under native conditions.},

The compounds exhibit a strong preference for the (R) stereochemistry at the transition state hydroxyl group. Molecular modeling studies with the prototype compound 11 have provided important insights into the structural requirements for good inhibitor-active site binding interaction. N-Terminal extension of 11 into the P2-P3 region led to the discovery of 19, the most potent enzyme inhibitor in the series (IC50 = 5.4 nM). 19 was shown to have potent antiviral activity in cultured MT-4 human T-lymphoid cells. Comparison of analogs of 19 with analogs of 1 (Ro31-8959) demonstrates that considerably different structure-activity relationships exist between these two subclasses of hydroxyethylamine HIV-protease inhibitors.},

abstract = {Norcoclaurine synthase catalyzes an asymmetric Pictet-Spengler condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to give (S)-norcoclaurine. This is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids that include morphine and codeine. In this work, the gene encoding for the Thalictrum flavum norcoclaurine synthase is highly overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting His-tagged recombinant enzyme is purified for the first time. A continuous assay based on circular dichroism spectroscopy is developed and used to monitor the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction. Dopamine analogues bearing a methoxy or hydrogen substituent in place of the C-1 phenolic group were readily accepted by the enzyme whereas those bearing the same substituents at C-2 were not. This supports a mechanism involving a two-step cyclization of the putative iminium ion intermediate that does not proceed via a spirocyclic intermediate. The reaction of [3,5,6-2H]dopamine was found to be slowed by a kinetic isotope effect of 1.7 +/- 0.1 on the value of kcat/KM. This is interpreted as showing that the deprotonation step causing rearomatization is partially rate determining in the overall reaction.},

This is especially true for hormone-dependent cancer, seeing that histone methylation by arginine methyltransferase I (PRMT1) is involved in the activation of sexual hormone receptors. Therefore, PRMT inhibitors are potential drugs and interesting tools for cell biology. A dapsone derivative called allantodapsone previously identified by our group served as a lead structure for inhibitor synthesis. Acylated derivatives of p-aminobenzenesulfonamides and the antilepra drug dapsone were identified as new inhibitors of PRMT1 by in vitro testing. The bis-chloroacetyl amide of dapsone selectively inhibited human PRMT1 in the low micromolar region and was selective for PRMT1 as compared to the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and the lysine methyltransferase Set7/9. It showed anticancer activity on MCF7a and LNCaP cells and blocked androgen dependent transcription specifically in a reporter gene system. Likewise, a transcriptional block was also demonstrated in LNCaP cells using quantitative RT-PCR on the mRNA of androgen dependent genes.},

New methodology developed within our laboratories provides an attractive low cost, 3D microarray-assisted screening platform that could be used to rapidly assay thousands of compounds. As a proof-of-principle the platform was exploited to screen a number of quorum sensing analogs. Quorum sensing is used by bacterium to initiate and spread infection; in this context its modulation may have significant clinical value. 3D microarray slides were probed with fluorescently labeled ligand-binding domains of the LuxR homolog CarR from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. The 3D microarray platform was used to discover the biologically active chloro-pyridine pharmacophore, which was validated using a fluorometric ligand binding assay and ITC. Analogs containing the chloro-pyridine pharmacophore were found to be potent inhibitors of N-acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) mediated quorum sensing phenotypes in Serratia (IC50 = 5 $\mu$M) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IC50 = 10–20 $\mu$M).},

abstract = {Interrogation of the evolutionary history underlying the remarkable structures and biological activities of natural products has been complicated by not knowing the functions they have evolved to fulfill. Siderophores-soluble, low molecular weight compounds-have an easily understood and measured function: acquiring iron from the environment. Bacteria engage in a fierce competition to acquire iron, which rewards the production of siderophores that bind iron tightly and cannot be used or pirated by competitors. The structures and biosyntheses of "odd" siderophores can reveal the evolutionary strategy that led to their creation. We report a new Serratia strain that produces serratiochelin and an analog of serratiochelin. A genetic approach located the serratiochelin gene cluster, and targeted mutations in several genes implicated in serratiochelin biosynthesis were generated. Bioinformatic analyses and mutagenesis results demonstrate that genes from two well-known siderophore clusters, the Escherichia coli enterobactin cluster and the Vibrio cholera vibriobactin cluster, were shuffled to produce a new siderophore biosynthetic pathway. These results highlight how modular siderophore gene clusters can be mixed and matched during evolution to generate structural diversity in siderophores.},

abstract = {The cloning and expression of the lux genes from different luminescent bacteria including marine and terrestrial species have led to significant advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology of bacterial bioluminescence. All lux operons have a common gene organization of luxCDAB(F)E, with luxAB coding for luciferase and luxCDE coding for the fatty acid reductase complex responsible for synthesizing fatty aldehydes for the luminescence reaction, whereas significant differences exist in their sequences and properties as well as in the presence of other lux genes (I, R, F, G, and H). Recognition of the regulatory genes as well as diffusible metabolites that control the growth-dependent induction of luminescence (autoinducers) in some species has advanced our understanding of this unique regulatory mechanism in which the autoinducers appear to serve as sensors of the chemical or nutritional environment. The lux genes have now been transferred into a variety of different organisms to generate new luminescent species. Naturally dark bacteria containing the luxCDABE and luxAB genes, respectively, are luminescent or emit light on addition of aldehyde. Fusion of the luxAB genes has also allowed the expression of luciferase under a single promoter in eukaryotic systems. The ability to express the lux genes in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and the ease and sensitivity of the luminescence assay demonstrate the considerable potential of the widespread application of the lux genes as reporters of gene expression and metabolic function.},

abstract = {The Vibrio fischeri luminescence genes are regulated by the LuxR protein and an N-acyl homoserine lactone compound termed the autoinducer. The C-terminal one-third of LuxR contains a domain that can interact with the transcription complex and activate the luminescence genes. On the basis of limited evidence it has been suggested that the N-terminal two-thirds of LuxR constitutes a domain that serves to bind the autoinducer. We show that tritium-labeled autoinducer binds to Escherichia coli cells in which LuxR is overexpressed. We also show that tritium-labeled autoinducer binds to E. coli in which truncated LuxR proteins missing portions of the C-terminal domain are expressed but does not bind to E. coli cells in which truncated LuxR proteins missing portions of the N-terminal region are expressed. Our results provide evidence that the autoinducer binds to LuxR and that in E. coli the N-terminal two-thirds of LuxR can fold into a polypeptide capable of binding the autoinducer in the absence of the C-terminal domain.},

Under conditions of iron limitation, these siderophore-modified antibiotics provide enhanced antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli strains, including uropathogenic E. coli CFT073 and UTI89, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, and enterotoxigenic E. coli O78:H11, compared to the parent $\beta$-lactams. Studies with E. coli K-12 derivatives defective in ferric enterobactin transport reveal that the enhanced antibacterial activity observed for this strain requires the outer membrane ferric enterobactin transporter FepA. A remarkable 1000-fold decrease in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value is observed for uropathogenic E. coli CFT073 relative to Amp/Amx, and time-kill kinetic studies demonstrate that Ent-Amp/Amx kill this strain more rapidly at 10-fold lower concentrations than the parent antibiotics. Moreover, Ent-Amp and Ent-Amx selectively kill E. coli CFT073 co-cultured with other bacterial species such as Staphylococcus aureus, and Ent-Amp exhibits low cytotoxicity against human T84 intestinal cells in both the apo and iron-bound forms. These studies demonstrate that the native enterobactin platform provides a means to effectively deliver antibacterial cargo across the outer membrane permeability barrier of Gram-negative pathogens utilizing enterobactin for iron acquisition.},

@article{Miyashiro2010,
abstract = {All members of the Vibrionaceae harbour LuxO, a response regulator that integrates outputs from various signalling systems, ultimately controlling specific traits that are crucial to the distinct biology of each species. LuxO is phosphorylated in response to low cell density, activating the transcription of a family of small RNAs called Qrrs, which in turn, control the levels of a global regulatory protein conserved within the Vibrionaceae. Although the function of each Qrr is similar, the number of qrr genes varies among the different species. Using a bioinformatics approach, we have determined the number of qrr genes in fully sequenced Vibrionaceae members. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the most recent common ancestor of all Vibrionaceae shared a single, ancestral qrr gene, which duplicated and diverged into multiple qrr genes in some present-day vibrio lineages. To demonstrate that a single qrr gene is sufficient to mediate repression of LitR, the global regulator in Vibrio fischeri, we have performed a series of genetic and phenotypic analyses of the LuxO pathway and its output. Our studies contribute to a better understanding of the ancestral state of these pathways in vibrios, as well as to the evolution and divergence of other sRNAs within different bacterial lineages.},

@article{Pesci1999,
abstract = {Numerous species of bacteria use an elegant regulatory mechanism known as quorum sensing to control the expression of specific genes in a cell-density dependent manner. In Gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing systems function through a cell-to-cell signal molecule (autoinducer) that consists of a homoserine lactone with a fatty acid side chain. Such is the case in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which contains two quorum sensing systems (las and rhl) that operate via the autoinducers, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone. The study of these signal molecules has shown that they bind to and activate transcriptional activator proteins that specifically induce numerous P. aeruginosa virulence genes. We report here that P. aeruginosa produces another signal molecule, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, which has been designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal. It was found that this unique cell-to-cell signal controlled the expression of lasB, which encodes for the major virulence factor, LasB elastase. We also show that the synthesis and bioactivity of Pseudomonas quinolone signal were mediated by the P. aeruginosa las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. The demonstration that 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone can function as an intercellular signal sheds light on the role of secondary metabolites and shows that P. aeruginosa cell-to-cell signaling is not restricted to acyl-homoserine lactones.},

abstract = {Bacterial communication systems, such as quorum sensing (QS), have provided new insights of alternative approaches in antimicrobial treatment. We recently reported that one QS signal, named as autoinducer-2 (AI-2), can affect the behaviors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in a dose-dependent manner. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AI-2 on P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation and virulence factors production in vitro, and in vivo using a pulmonary infection mouse model. Exogenous AI-2 resulted in increased biofilms architecture, the number of viable cells, and the yield of pyocyanin and elastase virulence factors in wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1. However, no such effect was observed in P. aeruginosa lasR rhlR mutant strain. In vivo, the use of AI-2 significantly increased the mortality, lung bacterial count and histological lung damage of mice with acute P. aeruginosa PAO1 infection. Our data suggest that AI-2 promotes the formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms and the production of virulence factors by interfering with P. aeruginosa QS systems, resulting in decreased host survival. AI-2 may be a therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of a co-infection of P. aeruginosa and AI-2 producing bacteria.},

Therefore, we used this fragment as a probe in Southern hybridization to compare pre- and post-therapy isolates of P. aeruginosa. The susceptible and resistant pairs were recovered from multiple sources (including sputum, blood, and urine) from patients treated with various doses of imipenem (n = 15), norfloxacin (n = 6), and ciprofloxacin (n = 4). Southern blot analysis showed identity between the pre- and post-therapy isolates in 23 of the 25 pairs. In the majority of pairs studied, failure to eradicate P. aeruginosa after therapy with imipenem, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin was due to the development of resistance rather than to reinfection.},

abstract = {Developed to complement the use of fluorescent proteins in live cell imaging, chemical tags enjoy the benefit of modular incorporation of organic fluorophores, opening the possibility of high photon output and special photophysical properties. However, the theoretical challenge in using chemical tags as opposed to fluorescent proteins for high-resolution imaging is background noise from unbound and/or nonspecifically bound ligand-fluorophore. We envisioned we could overcome this limit by engineering fluorogenic trimethoprim-based chemical tags (TMP-tags) in which the fluorophore is quenched until binding with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR)-tagged protein displaces the quencher. Thus, we began by building a nonfluorogenic, covalent TMP-tag based on a proximity-induced reaction known to achieve rapid and specific labeling both in vitro and inside of living cells. Here we take the final step and render the covalent TMP-tag fluorogenic. In brief, we designed a trimeric TMP-fluorophore-quencher molecule (TMP-Q-Atto520) with the quencher attached to a leaving group that, upon TMP binding to eDHFR, would be cleaved by a cysteine residue (Cys) installed just outside the binding pocket of eDHFR. We present the in vitro experiments showing that the eDHFR:L28C nucleophile cleaves the TMP-Q-Atto520 rapidly and efficiently, resulting in covalent labeling and remarkable fluorescence enhancement. Most significantly, while only our initial design, TMP-Q-Atto520 achieved the demanding goal of not only labeling highly abundant, localized intracellular proteins but also less abundant, more dynamic cytoplasmic proteins. These results suggest that the fluorogenic TMP-tag can significantly impact high-resolution live cell imaging and further establish the potential of proximity-induced reactivity and organic chemistry more broadly as part of the growing toolbox for synthetic biology and cell engineering.},

abstract = {The enzymes for luminescence in Vibrio fischeri are induced by the accumulation of a species-specific metabolite (autoinducer) in the culture medium. Tritium-labeled autoinducer was used to study the mechanism of autoinduction. When 3H-autoinducer was added to suspensions of V. fischeri or Escherichia coli, cellular concentrations equaled external concentrations. For V. fischeri, equilibration of 3H-autoinducer was rapid (within 20 s), and greater than 90% of the cellular tritium remained in unmodified autoinducer. When V. fischeri or E. coli cells containing 3H-autoinducer were transferred to autoinducer-free buffer, 85 to 99.5% of the radiotracer escaped from the cells, depending on the strain. Concentrations of autoinducer as low as 10 nM, which is equivalent to 1 or 2 molecules per cell, were sufficient for induction, and the maximal response to autoinducer occurred at about 200 nM. If external autoinducer concentrations were decreased to below 10 nM after induction had commenced, the induction response did not continue. Based on this study, a model for autoinduction is described wherein autoinducer association with cells is by simple diffusion and binding of autoinducer to its active site is reversible.},

abstract = {Recombinant E. coli that produce light were found in a clone library of hybrid plasmids containing DNA from the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. All luminescent clones had a 16 kb insert that encoded enzymatic activities for the light reaction as well as regulatory functions necessary for expression of the luminescence phenotype (Lux). Mutants generated by transposons Tn5 and mini-Mu were used to define Lux functions and to determine the genetic organization of the lux region. Regulatory and enzymatic functions were assigned to regions of two lux operons. With transcriptional fusions between the lacZ gene or transposon mini-Mu and the target gene, expression of lux operons could be measured in the absence of light production. The direction of transcription of lux operons was deduced from the orientation of mini-Mu insertions in the fusion plasmids. Induction of transcription of one lux operon required a function encoded by that operon (autoregulation). From these and other regulatory relationships, we propose a model for genetic control of light production.},

abstract = {For many years, DNA gyrase was thought to be responsible both for unlinking replicated daughter chromosomes and for controlling negative superhelical tension in bacterial DNA. However, in 1990 a homolog of gyrase, topoisomerase IV, that had a potent decatenating activity was discovered. It is now clear that topoisomerase IV, rather than gyrase, is responsible for decatenation of interlinked chromosomes. Moreover, topoisomerase IV is a target of the 4-quinolones, antibacterial agents that had previously been thought to target only gyrase. The key event in quinolone action is reversible trapping of gyrase-DNA and topoisomerase IV-DNA complexes. Complex formation with gyrase is followed by a rapid, reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis, cessation of growth, and induction of the SOS response. At higher drug concentrations, cell death occurs as double-strand DNA breaks are released from trapped gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV complexes. Repair of quinolone-induced DNA damage occurs largely via recombination pathways. In many gram-negative bacteria, resistance to moderate levels of quinolone arises from mutation of the gyrase A protein and resistance to high levels of quinolone arises from mutation of a second gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV site. For some gram-positive bacteria, the situation is reversed: primary resistance occurs through changes in topoisomerase IV while gyrase changes give additional resistance. Gyrase is also trapped on DNA by lethal gene products of certain large, low-copy-number plasmids. Thus, quinolone-topoisomerase biology is providing a model for understanding aspects of host-parasite interactions and providing ways to investigate manipulation of the bacterial chromosome by topoisomerases.},

The most common class of autoinducer used by Gram-negative bacteria are N-acylated-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a clinically important bacterium which is known to use AHL-mediated quorum sensing systems to regulate a variety of processes associated with virulence. Thus the selective disruption of AHL-based quorum sensing represents a strategy to attenuate the pathogenicity of this bacterium. Herein we describe the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a collection of structurally novel AHL mimics. A number of new compounds capable of modulating the LasR-dependent quorum sensing system of P. aeruginosa were identified, which could have value as molecular tools to study and manipulate this signalling pathway. Worthy of particular note, this research has delivered novel potent quorum sensing antagonists, which strongly inhibit the production of virulence factors in a wild type strain of this pathogenic bacterium.},

Previously we have shown that in PAN067, an elastase-negative mutant of PAO1, elastase production can be restored to some extent by addition of exogenous N(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (OHHL). Here we report that PAN067 is also defective in the production of alkaline protease, haemolysin, cyanide, pyocyanin and autoinducer(s). As neither addition of exogenous OdDHL nor introduction of IasR restored PAN067 to the parental phenotype, we sought to complement PAN067 with PAO1 DNA. From a cosmid library, a 2 kb DNA fragment was identified which re-established production of autoinducer(s) and exoproducts in PAN067. From the nucleotide sequence of this fragment, two genes termed rhIR and rhII were identified. RhII is responsible for autoinducer synthesis and shares 31\% homology with LasI; RhIR has been previously identified in P. aeruginosa strain DSM2659 as a regulator of rhamnolipid biosynthesis and shares 28\% identity with LasR. These data provide clear evidence that multiple families of quorum-sensing modulons interactively regulate gene expression in P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a spectrum of exoproducts many of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human infection. Expression of some of these factors requires cell-cell communication involving the interaction of a small diffusible molecule, an "autoinducer," with a positive transcriptional activator. In P. aeruginosa PAO1, LasI directs the synthesis of the autoinducer N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), which activates the positive transcriptional activator, LasR. Recently, we have discovered a second signaling molecule-based modulon in PAO1, termed vsm, which contains the genes vsmR and vsmI. Using HPLC, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy we now establish that in Escherichia coli, VsmI directs the synthesis of N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) and N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (HHL). These compounds are present in the spent culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa in a molar ratio of approximately 15:1 and their structures were unequivocally confirmed by chemical synthesis. Addition of either BHL or HHL to PAN067, a pleiotropic P. aeruginosa mutant unable to synthesize either of these autoinducers, restored elastase, chitinase, and cyanide production. In E. coli carrying a vsmR/vsmI'::lux transcriptional fusion, BHL and HHL activated VsmR to a similar extent. Analogues of these N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones in which the N-acyl side chain has been extended and/or oxidized at the C-3 position exhibit substantially lower activity (e.g., OdDHL) or no activity (e.g., dDHL) in this lux reporter assay. These data indicate that multiple families of quorum sensing modulons interactively regulate gene expression in P. aeruginosa.},

In fact, studies carried out on the lead WM5 showed that this derivative is able to inhibit the Tat-mediated long terminal repeat driven transcription, an essential step in the HIV-1 replication cycle. Thus, starting from lead WM5, we performed the design and synthesis of an enlarged series of 6-aminoquinolones, which permitted some very potent anti-HIV 6-amino derivatives to be obtained and the structure-activity relationship to be delineated. Some derivatives, 26c, 26e, 26i, and 26j, proved to be highly effective in inhibiting HIV replication at 50% inhibitory concentration in the range of 0.0087-0.7 microg/mL in MT-4, PBMCs and CEM cell lines coupled with positive selectivity indexes that reach values higher than 1000 on CEM cell lines for compounds 26e and 26i.

abstract = {Pyochelin is a siderophore and virulence factor common to Burkholderia cepacia and several Pseudomonas strains. We describe at 2.0{\AA} resolution the crystal structure of the pyochelin outer membrane receptor FptA bound to the iron-pyochelin isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One pyochelin molecule bound to iron is found in the protein structure, providing the first three-dimensional structure at the atomic level of this siderophore. The pyochelin molecule provides a tetra-dentate coordination of iron, while the remaining bi-dentate coordination is ensured by another molecule not specifically recognized by the protein. The overall structure of the pyochelin receptor is typical of the TonB-dependent transporter superfamily, which uses the proton motive force from the cytoplasmic membrane through the TonB–ExbB–ExbD energy transducing complex to transport ferric ions across the bacterial outer membrane: a transmembrane 22 $\beta$-stranded barrel occluded by a N-terminal domain that contains a mixed four-stranded $\beta$-sheet. The N-terminal TonB box is disordered in two crystal forms, and loop L8 is found to point towards the iron–pyochelin complex, suggesting that the receptor is in a transport-competent conformation.},

abstract = {The bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi controls light production (lux) by an elaborate quorum-sensing circuit. V. harveyi produces and responds to two different autoinducer signals (AI-1 and AI-2) to modulate the luciferase structural operon (luxCDABEGH) in response to changes in cell-population density. Unlike all other Gram-negative quorum-sensing organisms, V. harveyi regulates quorum sensing using a two-component phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade. Each autoinducer is recognized by a cognate hybrid sensor kinase (called LuxN and LuxQ). Both sensors transduce information to a shared phosphorelay protein called LuxU, which in turn conveys the signal to the response regulator protein LuxO. Phospho-LuxO is responsible for repression of luxCDABEGH expression at low cell density. In the present study, we demonstrate that LuxO functions as an activator protein via interaction with the alternative sigma factor, sigma54 (encoded by rpoN). Our results suggest that LuxO, together with sigma54, activates the expression of a negative regulator of luminescence. We also show that phenotypes other than lux are regulated by LuxO and sigma54, demonstrating that in Vibrio harveyi, quorum sensing controls multiple processes.},

abstract = {Motility is required for Vibrio fischeri cells to interact with and specifically colonize the light-emitting organ of their host, the squid Euprymna scolopes. To investigate the influence of motility on the expression of the symbiotic phenotype, we isolated mutants of the squid symbiont V. fischeri ES114 that had altered migration abilities. Spontaneous hyperswimmer (HS) mutants, which migrated more rapidly in soft agar and were hyperflagellated relative to the wild type, were isolated and grouped into three phenotypic classes. All of the HS strains tested, regardless of class, were delayed in symbiosis initiation. This result suggested that the hypermotile phenotype alone contributes to an inability to colonize squid normally. Class III HS strains showed the greatest colonization defect: they colonized squid to a level that was only 0.1 to 10% that achieved by ES114. In addition, class III strains were defective in two capabilities, hemagglutination and luminescence, that have been previously described as colonization factors in V. fischeri. Class II and III mutants also share a mucoid colony morphology; however, class II mutants can colonize E. scolopes to a level that was 40% of that achieved by ES114. Thus, the mucoid phenotype alone does not contribute to the greater defect exhibited by class III strains. When squid were exposed to ES114 and any one of the HS mutant strains as a coinoculation, the parent strain dominated the resulting symbiotic light-organ population. To further investigate the colonization defects of the HS strains, we used confocal laser-scanning microscopy to visualize V. fischeri cells in their initial interaction with E. scolopes tissue. Compared to ES114, HS strains from all three classes were delayed in two behaviors involved in colonization: (i) aggregation on host-derived mucus structures and (ii) migration to the crypts. These results suggest that, while motility is required to initiate colonization, the presence of multiple flagella may actually interfere with normal aggregation and attachment behavior. Furthermore, the pleiotropic nature of class III HS strains provides evidence that motility is coregulated with other symbiotic determinants in V. fischeri.},

abstract = {The bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri and juveniles of the squid Euprymna scolopes specifically recognize and respond to one another during the formation of a persistent colonization within the host's nascent light-emitting organ. The resulting fully developed light organ contains brightly luminescing bacteria and has undergone a bacterium-induced program of tissue differentiation, one component of which is a swelling of the epithelial cells that line the symbiont-containing crypts. While the luminescence (lux) genes of symbiotic V. fischeri have been shown to be highly induced within the crypts, the role of these genes in the initiation and persistence of the symbiosis has not been rigorously examined. We have constructed and examined three mutants (luxA, luxI, and luxR), defective in either luciferase enzymatic or regulatory proteins. All three are unable to induce normal luminescence levels in the host and, 2 days after initiating the association, had a three- to fourfold defect in the extent of colonization. Surprisingly, these lux mutants also were unable to induce swelling in the crypt epithelial cells. Complementing, in trans, the defect in light emission restored both normal colonization capability and induction of swelling. We hypothesize that a diminished level of oxygen consumption by a luciferase-deficient symbiotic population is responsible for the reduced fitness of lux mutants in the light organ crypts. This study is the first to show that the capacity for bioluminescence is critical for normal cell-cell interactions between a bacterium and its animal host and presents the first examples of V. fischeri genes that affect normal host tissue development.},

A screen for additional components of the Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio cholerae quorum-sensing circuits revealed the protein Hfq. Hfq mediates interactions between small, regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and specific messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. These interactions typically alter the stability of the target transcripts. We show that Hfq mediates the destabilization of the mRNA encoding the quorum-sensing master regulators LuxR (V. harveyi) and HapR (V. cholerae), implicating an sRNA in the circuit. Using a bioinformatics approach to identify putative sRNAs, we identified four candidate sRNAs in V. cholerae. The simultaneous deletion of all four sRNAs is required to stabilize hapR mRNA. We propose that Hfq, together with these sRNAs, creates an ultrasensitive regulatory switch that controls the critical transition into the high cell density, quorum-sensing mode.},

This novel assay was then used in a microtiter plate-based screen of a library of 18 potential amine substrates. From this screen it was discovered that propargyl amine serves as an excellent substrate for TG2. Subsequently, propargyl amine and 2-azidoethyl amine were validated independently as TG2 substrates with K(M) values of 44 ± 4 $\mu$M, and 0.99 ± 0.06 mM, respectively. In a proof-of-principle protein labelling experiment, the protein casein was selectively functionalized with propargyl amine using TG2 and subsequently fluorescently labelled through a dipolar cycloaddition reaction with an azido-fluorescein conjugate. This application demonstrates the strong potential of using TG2 for site-specific protein modification through a combination of enzymatic and bioorthogonal chemistry.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients and is a major source of nosocomial infections. This bacterium controls many virulence factors by using two quorum-sensing systems, las and rhl. The las system is composed of the LasR regulator protein and its cell-to-cell signal, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone, and the rhl system is composed of RhlR and the signal N-butyryl homoserine lactone. A third intercellular signal, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS; 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone), also regulates numerous virulence factors. PQS synthesis requires the expression of multiple operons, one of which is pqsABCDE. Previous experiments showed that the transcription of this operon, and therefore PQS production, is negatively regulated by the rhl quorum-sensing system and positively regulated by the las quorum-sensing system and PqsR (also known as MvfR), a LysR-type transcriptional regulator protein. With the use of DNA mobility shift assays and beta-galactosidase reporter fusions, we have studied the regulation of pqsR and its relationship to pqsA, lasR, and rhlR. We show that PqsR binds the promoter of pqsA and that this binding increases dramatically in the presence of PQS, implying that PQS acts as a coinducer for PqsR. We have also mapped the transcriptional start site for pqsR and found that the transcription of pqsR is positively regulated by lasR and negatively regulated by rhlR. These results suggest that a regulatory chain occurs where pqsR is under the control of LasR and RhlR and where PqsR in turn controls pqsABCDE, which is required for the production of PQS.},

Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth contributes to the chronicity of infections such as those associated with implanted medical devices. The mechanisms of resistance in biofilms are different from the now familiar plasmids, transposons, and mutations that confer innate resistance to individual bacterial cells. In biofilms, resistance seems to depend on multicellular strategies. We summarise the features of biofilm infections, review emerging mechanisms of resistance, and discuss potential therapies.},

abstract = {The transcriptional regulator MvfR is required for full Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence, the function of multiple quorum sensing (QS)-regulated virulence factors and the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs), including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). Here we investigate the role of MvfR in the QS circuitry and P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. We demonstrate using a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches, including transcription profiling, that MvfR is involved in the regulation of multiple P. aeruginosa QS-controlled genes without altering the expression of lasRI/rhlRI or the production of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals. Dissection of how mvfR is interwoven into the P. aeruginosa QS circuitry reveals that the MvfR system, through the essential contribution of PqsE, positively regulates a subset of genes dependant on both LasR and RhlR. Animal studies show that MvfR contributes to P. aeruginosa virulence by controlling the transcription of genes not under RhlR regulation, and that reduced virulence of a mvfR mutant is caused by the loss of pqsE expression and not only a deficiency in HAQs/PQS production. This study provides novel insights into the unique role of the MvfR system in AHL-mediated QS and further supports its importance in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.},

abstract = {A biofilm is a structured consortium of bacteria embedded in a self-produced polymer matrix consisting of polysaccharide, protein and DNA. Bacterial biofilms cause chronic infections because they show increased tolerance to antibiotics and disinfectant chemicals as well as resisting phagocytosis and other components of the body's defence system. The persistence of, for example, staphylococcal infections related to foreign bodies is due to biofilm formation. Likewise, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients is caused by biofilm-growing mucoid strains. Characteristically, gradients of nutrients and oxygen exist from the top to the bottom of biofilms and these gradients are associated with decreased bacterial metabolic activity and increased doubling times of the bacterial cells; it is these more or less dormant cells that are responsible for some of the tolerance to antibiotics. Biofilm growth is associated with an increased level of mutations as well as with quorum-sensing-regulated mechanisms. Conventional resistance mechanisms such as chromosomal $\beta$-lactamase, upregulated efflux pumps and mutations in antibiotic target molecules in bacteria also contribute to the survival of biofilms. Biofilms can be prevented by early aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis or therapy and they can be treated by chronic suppressive therapy. A promising strategy may be the use of enzymes that can dissolve the biofilm matrix (e.g. DNase and alginate lyase) as well as quorum-sensing inhibitors that increase biofilm susceptibility to antibiotics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.},

abstract = {In Vibrio fischeri, the autoinducer N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (AI-1) governs the cell density-dependent induction of the luminescence operon via the LuxR transcriptional activator. The synthesis of AI-1 from bacterial metabolic intermediates is dependent on luxI. Recently, we found a second V. fischeri autoinducer molecule, N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (AI-2), that in E. coli also activates the luminescence operon via LuxR. A locus independent of luxI was identified as being required for AI-2 synthesis. This 2.7-kb ain (autoinducer) locus was characterized by transposon insertion mutagenesis, deletion and complementation analysis, and DNA sequencing. A single 1,185-bp gene, ainS, was found to be the sole exogenous gene necessary for the synthesis of AI-2 in Escherichia coli. In addition, a V. fischeri ainS mutant produced AI-1 but not AI-2, confirming that in its native species ainS is specific for the synthesis of AI-2. ainS is predicted to encode a 45,580-Da protein which exhibits no similarity to LuxI or to any of the LuxI homologs responsible for the synthesis of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones in a variety of other bacteria. The existence of two different and unrelated autoinducer synthesis genes suggests the occurrence of convergent evolution in the synthesis of homoserine lactone signaling molecules. The C-terminal half of AinS shows homology to a putative protein in Vibrio harveyi, LuxM, which is required for the synthesis of a V. harveyi bioluminescence autoinducer. Together, AinS and LuxM define a new family of autoinducer synthesis proteins. Furthermore, the predicted product of another gene, ainR, encoded immediately downstream of ainS, shows homology to LuxN, which is similarly encoded downstream of luxM in V. harveyi and proposed to have sensor/regulator functions in the bioluminescence response to the V. harveyi auto inducer. This similarity presents the possibility that AI-2, besides interacting with LuxR, also interacts with AinR under presently unknown conditions.},

abstract = {Bacterial quorum sensing evolved as a means for bacterial communities to rapidly and coordinately change genome expression patterns in response to environmental cues. Each cell in a community produces and responds to a signaling molecule called an autoinducer that serves as an indicator of the population density. A high concentration of autoinducer is associated with a large, often confined population, which requires altered gene expression for survival. Quorum sensing is one mechanism through which a bacterial population receives input from the environment and elicits an appropriate response. Because many pathogens require quorum sensing to produce virulence factors in response to association with a human host, the signaling pathway is a target for design of small-molecule inhibitors.},

abstract = {Syntheses and evaluation of fluoroalkylated ciprofloxacin analogues are described. Among these analogues, N₄'-3-fluoropropylciprofloxacin (16) showed the most efficient antibacterial activity against E. coli strains (DH5$\alpha$ and TOP10) and a high binding affinity for DNA gyrase of bacteria. To develop bacteria-specific infection imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET), no-carrier-added N₄-3-[¹⁸F]fluoropropylciprofloxacin ([¹⁸F]16) was prepared in two steps from N₄-3-methanesufonyloxypropylciprofloxacin, resulting in a 40% radiochemical yield (decay corrected for 100 min) via the tert-alcohol media radiofluorination protocol with high radiochemical purity (> 99%) as well as high specific activity (149 ± 75 GBq/$\mu$mol). The agent was stable (> 90%), as shown by an in vitro human serum stability assay. A bacterial uptake and blocking study of [¹⁸F]16 using authentic compound 16 in TOP10 cells demonstrated its high specific bacterial uptake. The results suggest that this radiotracer holds promise as a useful bacterial infection radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging.},

abstract = {Two-component signal transduction systems enable bacteria to sense, respond, and adapt to a wide range of environments, stressors, and growth conditions. In the prototypical two-component system, a sensor histidine kinase catalyzes its autophosphorylation and then subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to a response regulator, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. The utility of these signaling systems is underscored by their prevalence throughout the bacterial kingdom and by the fact that many bacteria contain dozens, or sometimes hundreds, of these signaling proteins. The presence of so many highly related signaling proteins in individual cells creates both an opportunity and a challenge. Do cells take advantage of the similarity between signaling proteins to integrate signals or diversify responses, and thereby enhance their ability to process information? Conversely, how do cells prevent unwanted cross-talk and maintain the insulation of distinct pathways? Here we address both questions by reviewing the cellular and molecular mechanisms that dictate the specificity of two-component signaling pathways.},

The antibacterial activity of the compound was compared directly with those of SQ 83,360 (pirazmonam) and aztreonam. U-78608, SQ 83,360, and aztreonam had generally poor activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. U-78608 demonstrated activity primarily against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with potency generally comparable to that of SQ 83,360. U-78608 and SQ 83,360 were less active than aztreonam for some gram-negative species; however, both compounds were 8- to 64-fold more active than aztreonam against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All three compounds resisted inactivation by several different beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Neither U-78608 nor SQ 83,360 exhibited significant inhibition of these enzymes, while aztreonam inhibited beta-lactamases from P. aeurginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. All three compounds exhibited strong affinity to PBP 3 of Escherichia coli and moderate to negligible affinity to the other E. coli PBPs; quantitative measurements indicated that U-78608 had greater PBP 3 affinity than either SQ 83,360 or aztreonam.},

We have found that mutants overexpressing OprM were two- and eightfold more resistant than their wild-type parent to sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP), respectively. For OprJ-overproducing strains, MICs of TMP increased fourfold but those of SMX were unchanged. Strains overexpressing OprM, but not those overexpressing OprJ, became hypersusceptible to TMP and SMX when oprM was inactivated. The wild-type antibiotic profile could be restored in an oprM mutant by transcomplementation with the cloned oprM gene. These results demonstrate that the mexABoprM multidrug efflux system is mainly responsible for the intrinsic resistance of P. aeruginosa to TMP and SMX.},

abstract = {Complementary approaches were employed to characterize transitional episodes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development using direct observation and whole-cell protein analysis. Microscopy and in situ reporter gene analysis were used to directly observe changes in biofilm physiology and to act as signposts to standardize protein collection for two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis and protein identification in chemostat and continuous-culture biofilm-grown populations. Using these approaches, we characterized five stages of biofilm development: (i) reversible attachment, (ii) irreversible attachment, (iii) maturation-1, (iv) maturation-2, and (v) dispersion. Biofilm cells were shown to change regulation of motility, alginate production, and quorum sensing during the process of development. The average difference in detectable protein regulation between each of the five stages of development was 35% (approximately 525 proteins). When planktonic cells were compared with maturation-2 stage biofilm cells, more than 800 proteins were shown to have a sixfold or greater change in expression level (over 50% of the proteome). This difference was higher than when planktonic P. aeruginosa were compared with planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas putida. Las quorum sensing was shown to play no role in early biofilm development but was important in later stages. Biofilm cells in the dispersion stage were more similar to planktonic bacteria than to maturation-2 stage bacteria. These results demonstrate that P. aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during biofilm development and that knowledge of stage-specific physiology may be important in detecting and controlling biofilm growth.},

abstract = {The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) continues to view with concern the lean pipeline for novel therapeutics to treat drug-resistant infections, especially those caused by gram-negative pathogens. Infections now occur that are resistant to all current antibacterial options. Although the IDSA is encouraged by the prospect of success for some agents currently in preclinical development, there is an urgent, immediate need for new agents with activity against these panresistant organisms. There is no evidence that this need will be met in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we remain concerned that the infrastructure for discovering and developing new antibacterials continues to stagnate, thereby risking the future pipeline of antibacterial drugs. The IDSA proposed solutions in its 2004 policy report, "Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic R&D Stagnates, a Public Health Crisis Brews," and recently issued a "Call to Action" to provide an update on the scope of the problem and the proposed solutions. A primary objective of these periodic reports is to encourage a community and legislative response to establish greater financial parity between the antimicrobial development and the development of other drugs. Although recent actions of the Food and Drug Administration and the 110th US Congress present a glimmer of hope, significant uncertainly remains. Now, more than ever, it is essential to create a robust and sustainable antibacterial research and development infrastructure--one that can respond to current antibacterial resistance now and anticipate evolving resistance. This challenge requires that industry, academia, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Department of Defense, and the new Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services work productively together. This report provides an update on potentially effective antibacterial drugs in the late-stage development pipeline, in the hope of encouraging such collaborative action.},

We report herein a highly robust and efficient strategy for high-throughput synthesis of a 325-member azide library. The method is highlighted by its simplicity and product purity.

Many potentially life-threatening conditions became easily curable, greatly reducing the incidence of death or disability resulting from bacterial infections. This overwhelming historical success makes it very difficult to imagine life without effective antibacterials; however, the inexorable rise of antibiotic resistance has made this a very real and disturbing possibility for some infections. The ruthless selection for resistant bacteria, coupled with insufficient investment in antibacterial research, has led to a steady decline in the efficacy of existing therapies and a paucity of novel structural classes with which to replace them, or complement their use. This situation has resulted in a very pressing need for the discovery of novel antibiotics and treatment strategies, the development of which is likely to be a key challenge to 21st century medicinal chemistry.},

A high-throughput screening effort identified the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine scaffold as a potent inhibitor of Jak2. Optimization of lead compounds 7a-b and 8 in this chemical series for activity against Jak2, selectivity against other Jak family kinases, and good in vivo pharmacokinetic properties led to the discovery of 7j. In a SET2 xenograft model that is dependent on Jak2 for growth, 7j demonstrated a time-dependent knock-down of pSTAT5, a downstream target of Jak2.},

abstract = {Synopsis: Trimethoprim,1 which has been widely available for several years in combination with sulphamethoxazole as co-trimoxazole, 2 is now available for use alone in the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Trimethoprim, which is active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, is readily absorbed by the oral route and is widely distributed in body fluids and tissues. In therapeutic trials, trimethoprim 200 to 400mg daily has been shown to be comparable in efficacy with co-trimoxazole, ampicillin 2g, cephalexin 2g, oxolinic acid 1.5g and nitrofurantoin 200mg daily in the treatment of acute urinary tract infection. Similarly, in long term prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection, trimethoprim 100mg daily given as a single dose at night was comparable with nitrofurantoin 50 to 100Omg, methenamine 1g, oxolinic acid 375mg or co-trimoxazole (80mg trimethoprim /1400mg sulphamethoxazole) each given as a single daily dose. Emergence of acquired resistance has been infrequent during years of therapeutic use of co-trimoxazole. Nevertheless, results of serial laboratory surveys suggest that resistance to trimethoprim among enterobacteria is increasing. However, at present, there is no conclusive evidence that there will be a more rapid increase following the introduction of trimethoprim for use alone in the treatment of urinary tract infections. At the dosages used, trimethoprim has generally been well tolerated and in studies comparing it with co-trimoxazole overall, skin rashes and gastrointestinal upset have occurred less frequently with trimethoprim than with co-trimoxazole.},

@article{Skold2000,
abstract = {Sulfonamides were the first drugs acting selectively on bacteria which could be used systemically. Today they are infrequently used, in part due to widespread resistance. The target of sulfonamides, and the basis for their selectivity, is the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) in the folic acid pathway. Mammalian cells are not dependent on endogenous synthesis of folic acid and generally lack DHPS. Instead, they have a folate uptake system which most prokaryotes lack. Laboratory mutants in the dhps (folP) gene can be easily isolated and show a trade off between sulfonamide resistance and DHPS enzyme performance. Clinical resistant mutants, however, have additional compensatory mutations in DHPS that allow it to function normally. In many pathogenic bacteria sulfonamide resistance is mediated by the horizontal transfer of foreign folP or parts of it. Clinical resistance in gram-negative enteric bacteria is plasmid-borne and is effected by genes encoding alternative drug-resistance variants of the DHPS enzymes. Two such genes, sul1 and sul2, have been sequenced and are found at roughly the same frequency among clinical isolates. Remarkably, the corresponding DHPS enzymes show pronounced insensitivity to sulfonamides but normal binding to the p -aminobenzoic acid substrate, despite the close structural similarity between substrate and inhibitor.

abstract = {Many gram-negative bacteria communicate by N-acyl homoserine lactone signals called autoinducers (AIs). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cell-to-cell signaling controls expression of extracellular virulence factors, the type II secretion apparatus, a stationary-phase sigma factor (sigmas), and biofilm differentiation. The fact that a similar signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone, freely diffuses through Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli cells has led to the assumption that all AIs are freely diffusible. In this work, transport of the two P. aeruginosa AIs, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) (formerly called PAI-1) and N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) (formerly called PAI-2), was studied by using tritium-labeled signals. When 3HC4-HSL was added to cell suspensions of P. aeruginosa, the cellular concentration reached a steady state in less than 30 s and was nearly equal to the external concentration, as expected for a freely diffusible compound. In contrast, 3H3OC12-HSL required about 5 min to reach a steady state, and the cellular concentration was 3 times higher than the external level. Addition of inhibitors of the cytoplasmic membrane proton gradient, such as azide, led to a strong increase in cellular accumulation of 3H3OC12-HSL, suggesting the involvement of active efflux. A defined mutant lacking the mexA-mexB-oprM-encoded active-efflux pump accumulated 3H3OC12-HSL to levels similar to those in the azide-treated wild-type cells. Efflux experiments confirmed these observations. Our results show that in contrast to the case for C4-HSL, P. aeruginosa cells are not freely permeable to 3OC12-HSL. Instead, the mexA-mexB-oprM-encoded efflux pump is involved in active efflux of 3OC12-HSL. Apparently the length and/or degree of substitution of the N-acyl side chain determines whether an AI is freely diffusible or is subject to active efflux by P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {The extracellular signaling molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) mediates quorum-sensing communication in diverse bacterial species. In marine vibrios, binding of AI-2 to the periplasmic receptor LuxP modulates the activity of the inner membrane sensor kinase LuxQ, transducing the AI-2 information into the cytoplasm. Here, we show that Vibrio harveyi LuxP associates with LuxQ in both the presence and absence of AI-2. The 1.9 {\AA} X-ray crystal structure of apoLuxP, complexed with the periplasmic domain of LuxQ, reveals that the latter contains two tandem Per/ARNT/Simple-minded (PAS) folds. Thus, although many prokaryotic PAS folds themselves bind ligands, the LuxQ periplasmic PAS folds instead bind LuxP, monitoring its AI-2 occupancy. Mutations that disrupt the apoLuxP:LuxQ interface sensitize V. harveyi to AI-2, implying that AI-2 binding causes the replacement of one set of LuxP:LuxQ contacts with another. These conformational changes switch LuxQ between two opposing enzymatic activities, each of which conveys information to the cytoplasm about the cell density of the surrounding environment.

We report here that the alkaline protease gene (apr) also requires the lasR gene for transcription. Alkaline protease mRNA was absent in the lasR mutant PAO-R1 and present when an intact lasR gene was supplied in trans as determined by Northern (RNA) analysis. The lasR gene also enhances exotoxin A production. Exotoxin A activity in supernatants of PAO-R1 were 30% less than in supernatants of the parental strain, PAO-SR. Multiple copies of lasR in trans in PAO-R1 in increased toxin A activity to twice the parental levels. Analysis of PAO-R1 containing the toxA promoter fused to beta-galactosidase suggests that LasR acts at the toxA promoter or at upstream toxA mRNA sequences. beta-Galactosidase activity was approximately 40% lower in PAO-R1 than in the parental strain, PAO-SR. Furthermore, the effect of LasR on the toxA promoter is not due to the stimulation of transcription of regA, a transcriptional activator of toxA. No difference in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was noted between PAO-SR and PAO-R1 containing transcriptional regA promoter-CAT gene fusions. These results broaden the regulatory dominion of lasR and suggest that the lasR gene plays a global role in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.},

Employing this strategy against organisms expressing efflux pumps from the MFS, MATE and RND classes of pump systems, we report here the identification of an ofloxacin-based EPI that is a potent inhibitor of MFS (NorA) and MATE (MepA) efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.

In a Y. enterocolitica yenI mutant, swimming motility is temporally delayed while swarming motility is abolished. Since both swimming and swarming are flagellum dependent, we purified the flagellin protein from the parent and yenI mutant. Electrophoresis revealed that in contrast to the parent strain, the yenI mutant grown for 17 h at 26 degrees C lacked the 45-kDa flagellin protein FleB. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that while mutation of yenI had no effect on yenR, flhDC (the motility master regulator) or fliA (the flagellar sigma factor) expression, fleB (the flagellin structural gene) was down-regulated. Since 3-oxo-C6-HSL and C6-HSL did not restore swimming or swarming in the yenI mutant, we reexamined the N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) profile of Y. enterocolitica. Using AHL biosensors and mass spectrometry, we identified three additional AHLs synthesized via YenI: N-(3-oxodecanoyl)homoserine lactone, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL), and N-(3-oxotetradecanoyl)homoserine lactone. However, none of the long-chain AHLs either alone or in combination with the short-chain AHLs restored swarming or swimming in the yenI mutant. By investigating the transport of radiolabeled 3-oxo-C12-HSL and by introducing an AHL biosensor into the yenI mutant we demonstrate that the inability of exogenous AHLs to restore motility to the yenI mutant is not related to a lack of AHL uptake. However, both AHL synthesis and motility were restored by complementation of the yenI mutant with a plasmid-borne copy of yenI.},

abstract = {The Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio harveyi produces and responds to three autoinducers, AI-1, AI-2, and CAI-1 to regulate cell density dependent gene expression by a process referred to as quorum sensing. The concentration of the autoinducers is sensed by three cognate hybrid sensor kinases, and information is channeled via the HPt protein LuxU to the response regulator LuxO. Here, a detailed biochemical study on the enzymatic activities of the membrane-integrated hybrid sensor kinase LuxN, the sensor for N-(d-3-hydroxybutanoyl)homoserine lactone (AI-1), is provided. LuxN was heterologously overproduced as the full-length protein in Escherichia coli. LuxN activities were characterized in vitro and are an autophosphorylation activity with an unusually high ATP turnover rate, stable LuxU phosphorylation, and a slow phosphatase activity with LuxU approximately P as substrate. The presence of AI-1 affected the kinase but not the phosphatase activity of LuxN. The influence of AI-1 on the LuxN--> LuxU signaling step was monitored, and in the presence of AI-1, the kinase activity of LuxN, and hence the amount of LuxU approximately P produced, were significantly reduced. Half-maximal inhibition of kinase activity by AI-1 occurred at 20 mum. Together, these results indicate that AI-1 directly interacts with LuxN to down-regulate its autokinase activity and suggest that the key regulatory step of the AI-1 quorum sensing system of Vibrio harveyi is AI-1-mediated repression of the LuxN kinase activity.},

abstract = {Expression of the Vibrio fischeri luminescence genes (lux genes) requires two transcriptional activators: the V. fischeri luxR gene product with autoinducer and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) with cAMP. It has been established that autoinducer and the luxR gene product are required for transcriptional activation of the luxICDABE operon, which contains a gene required for autoinducer synthesis and genes required for light emission. However, the role of cAMP-CRP in the induction of luminescence is not clear. We examined transcriptional control of the lux genes in Escherichia coli, using catabolite repression mutants carrying lux DNA-containing plasmids. Transcriptional fusions between the lacZ gene on Mu dI and luxR were used to assess luxR promoter activity, and the luxAB genes (which encode the two luciferase subunits) were used as a natural reporter of luxICDABE promoter activity. A plasmid containing luxR under control of the cAMP-CRP-independent tac promoter was constructed to direct the synthesis of the luxR gene product in cells containing compatible luxR::Mu dI insertion mutant plasmids. In E. coli, cAMP-CRP activated transcription of luxR and concurrently decreased luxICDABE transcription. In the presence of relatively high levels of the luxR gene product, cAMP and CRP were not required for induction of the luxICDABE operon. The luxR gene product in the presence of autoinducer activated transcription of the luxICDABE operon, as has been shown previously, and we demonstrate that it also decreased luxR transcription. Apparently, control of the V. fischeri luminescence genes involves a regulatory circuit in which cAMP and CRP activate luxR transcription and in turn the luxR gene product activates transcription of the operon responsible for light emission (uxICDABE). Furthermore, in lux gene regulation cAMP-CRP and autoinducer-LuxR protein appear to function as transcriptional antagonists.},

abstract = {Vibrio fischeri serves as a valuable model of bacterial bioluminescence, its regulation, and its functional significance. Light output varies more than 10,000-fold in wild-type isolates from different environments, yet dim and bright strains have similar organization of the light-producing lux genes, with the activator-encoding luxR divergently transcribed from luxICDABEG. By comparing the genomes of bright strain MJ11 and the dimmer ES114, we found that the lux region has diverged more than most shared orthologs, including those flanking lux. Divergence was particularly high in the intergenic sequence between luxR and luxI. Analysis of the intergenic lux region from 18 V. fischeri strains revealed that, with one exception, sequence divergence essentially mirrored strain phylogeny but with relatively high substitution rates. The bases conserved among intergenic luxR-luxI sequences included binding sites for known regulators, such as LuxR and ArcA, and bases of unknown significance, including a striking palindromic repeat. By using this collection of diverse luxR-luxI regions, we found that expression of P(luxI)-lacZ but not P(luxR)-lacZ transcriptional reporters correlated with the luminescence output of the strains from which the promoters originated. We also found that exchange of a small stretch of the luxI-luxR intergenic region between two strains largely reversed their relative brightness. Our results show that the luxR-luxI intergenic region contributes significantly to the variable luminescence output among V. fischeri strains isolated from different environments, although other elements of strain backgrounds also contribute. Moreover, the lux system appears to have evolved relatively rapidly, suggesting unknown environment-specific selective pressures.},

abstract = {The increased use of fluoroquinolones has led to increasing resistance to these antimicrobials, with rates of resistance that vary by both organism and geographic region. Resistance to fluoroquinolones typically arises as a result of alterations in the target enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) and of changes in drug entry and efflux. Mutations are selected first in the more susceptible target: DNA gyrase, in gram-negative bacteria, or topoisomerase IV, in gram-positive bacteria. Additional mutations in the next most susceptible target, as well as in genes controlling drug accumulation, augment resistance further, so that the most-resistant isolates have mutations in several genes. Resistance to quinolones can also be mediated by plasmids that produce the Qnr protein, which protects the quinolone targets from inhibition. Qnr plasmids have been found in the United States, Europe, and East Asia. Although Qnr by itself produces only low-level resistance, its presence facilitates the selection of higher-level resistance mutations, thus contributing to the alarming increase in resistance to quinolones.},

abstract = {The Vibrio fischeri luminescence (lux) genes are regulated by the 250-amino-acid-residue LuxR protein and a V. fischeri metabolite termed autoinducer. The V. fischeri lux regulon consists of two divergently transcribed units. Autoinducer and LuxR activate transcription of the luxICDABE operon and autoregulate the luxR transcriptional unit. LuxR proteins with C-terminal truncations of up to 40 amino acid residues coded by plasmids with luxR 3'-deletion mutations are functional in negative autoregulation as demonstrated by using a luxR::lacZ transcriptional fusion as a luxR promoter probe in Escherichia coli. The truncated LuxR proteins showed little or no ability to activate transcription of luxICDABE, as indicated by using luminescence as a sensitive indicator of promoter strength in E. coli. Besides having no detectable activity as positive regulators of luxICDABE, LuxR proteins with C-terminal truncations of more than 40 amino acid residues had reduced or no detectable activity as negative autoregulators. The results suggest that amino acid residues in LuxR prior to no. 211 are sufficient for lux DNA binding. Residues in the region of 211 to 250 constitute a C-terminal tail that appears to be involved in activation of luxICDABE transcription either by interacting physically with the transcription initiation complex or by affecting lux DNA in the vicinity of the promoter.},

abstract = {Methods of cell culture which enable the control of specific growth rate and expression of iron-regulated membrane proteins within Gram-negative biofilms were employed for various clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa taken from the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and of a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli. Susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin was assessed as a function of growth-rate for intact biofilms, cells resuspended from the biofilms and also for newly formed daughter cells shed from the biofilm during its growth and development. Patterns of susceptibility with growth rate were compared to those of suspended cultures grown in a chemostat. In all instances the susceptibility of chemostat cultures was directly related to growth rate. Whilst little difference was observed in the susceptibility pattern for P. aeruginosa strains with different observed levels of mucoidness, such populations were generally more susceptible towards ciprofloxacin than those of E. coli. At fast rates of growth P. aeruginosa cells resuspended from biofilms were significantly more resistant than chemostat grown cells. Intact P. aeruginosa biofilms were significantly more resistant than cells resuspended from them. This is in contrast to E. coli, where cells resuspended from biofilm and intact biofilms were, at the slower rates of growth, equivalent and significantly more susceptible than chemostat-grown cells. At high growth rates all methods of E. coli culture produced cells of equivalent susceptibility. For all strains, daughter cells dislodged from the biofilms demonstrated a high level of susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin which was unaffected by growth rate. This sensitivity corresponded to that of the fastest grown cells in the chemostat.},

The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, and the presumption has often been that FES may somehow promote adaptive changes in cortical connectivity. However, the unique feature of electrical stimulation is that it activates nerve fibres both orthodromically and antidromically. The antidromic impulse in motor nerve fibres will reach the anterior horn cell, but it can go no further up the neuraxis. If the corticospinal-anterior horn cell synapse is a Hebb-type modifiable synapse (i.e. one that is strengthened by the coincidence of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity), then FES, combined with coincident voluntary effort through a damaged pyramidal motor system, could help to promote restorative synaptic modifications at anterior horn cell level, by this unique adaptive mechanism.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen characterized by an innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. A major contribution to this intrinsic multidrug resistance is provided by a number of broadly-specific multidrug efflux systems, including MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM. In addition, these and two additional tripartite efflux systems, MexCD-OprJ and MexEF-OprN, promote acquired multidrug resistance as a result of mutational hyperexpression of the efflux genes. In addition to antibiotics, these pumps promote export of numerous dyes, detergents, inhibitors, disinfectants, organic solvents and homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing. The efflux pump proteins are highly homologous and consist of a cytoplasmic membrane-associated drug-proton antiporter of the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, an outer membrane channel-forming protein [sometimes called outer membrane factor (OMF)] and a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP). Homologues of these systems have been described in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Burkholderia pseudomallei and the non-pathogen Pseudomonas putida, where they play a role in export of and resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents and/or organic solvents. Although the natural function of these multidrug efflux systems is largely unknown, their contribution to antibiotic resistance and their conservation in a number of important human pathogens makes them logical targets for therapeutic intervention.},

These signals are synthesized by members of the LuxI family of proteins. To understand the mechanism of acyl-HSL synthesis we have purified the Pseudomonas aeruginosa RhlI protein and analyzed the kinetics of acyl-HSL synthesis by this enzyme. Purified RhlI catalyzes the synthesis of acyl-HSLs from acyl-acyl carrier proteins and S-adenosylmethionine. An analysis of the patterns of product inhibition indicated that RhlI catalyzes signal synthesis by a sequential, ordered reaction mechanism in which S-adenosylmethionine binds to RhlI as the initial step in the enzymatic mechanism. Because pathogenic bacteria such as P. aeruginosa use acyl-HSL signals to regulate virulence genes, an understanding of the mechanism of signal synthesis and identification of inhibitors of signal synthesis has implications for development of quorum sensing-targeted antivirulence molecules.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri has a pronounced diel rhythm, one component of which is the venting of the contents of the light organ into the surrounding seawater each day at dawn. In this study, we explored the use of this behavior to sample the microenvironment of the light-organ crypts. Intact crypt contents, which emerge from the lateral pores of the organ as a thick paste-like exudate, were collected from anesthetized host animals that had been exposed to a light cue. Microscopy revealed that the expelled material is composed of a conspicuous population of host cells in association with the bacterial symbionts, all of which are embedded in a dense acellular matrix that strongly resembles the bacteria-based biofilms described in other systems. Assays of the viability of expelled crypt cells revealed no dead bacterial symbionts and a mixture of live and dead host cells. Analyses of the ultrastructure, biochemistry, and phagocytic activity of a subset of the host cell population suggested that some of these cells are macrophage-like molluscan hemocytes.},

The cocrystal structures of these molecules bound to Hsp90 have been determined, and through molecular modeling and superimposition of these ligands, hybrids of radicicol and geldanamycin have been designed. A series of macrocylic chimeras of radicicol and geldanamycin and the corresponding seco-agents have been prepared and evaluated for both antiproliferative activity and their ability to induce Hsp90-dependent client protein degradation.},

abstract = {Bacteria communicate through the production of diffusible signal molecules termed autoinducers. The molecules are produced at basal levels and accumulate during growth. Once a critical concentration has been reached, autoinducers can activate or repress a number of target genes. Because the control of gene expression by autoinducers is cell-density-dependent, this phenomenon has been called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing controls virulence gene expression in numerous micro-organisms. In some cases, this phenomenon has proven relevant for bacterial virulence in vivo. In this article, we provide a few examples to illustrate how quorum sensing can act to control bacterial virulence in a multitude of ways. Several classes of autoinducers have been described to date and we present examples of how each of the major types of autoinducer can be involved in bacterial virulence. As quorum sensing controls virulence, it has been considered an attractive target for the development of new therapeutic strategies. We discuss some of the new strategies to combat bacterial virulence based on the inhibition of bacterial quorum sensing systems.},

abstract = {N-acylhomoserine lactone-dependent quorum sensing was first discovered in two luminescent marine bacteria, Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio harveyi. The LuxI/R system of V. fischeri is the paradigm of Gram-negative quorum-sensing systems; however, it is not found in all vibrios. A more complex quorum-sensing regulation is found in V. harveyi. Three parallel systems transmit signals via phosphorelays that converge onto one regulatory protein LuxO. Components of the three systems are found only in vibrios. Of the five Vibrio strains analysed, the number and types of signal circuits found in each strain are diverse. The signalling systems have different regulatory responses depending on the type of association the Vibrio strains have with an animal host, which may reflect the diverse roles the vibrios have in structuring and maintaining microniches within the aquatic milieu. Further studies are likely to show that the diversity and complexity of the Vibrio quorum-sensing systems coordinate intraspecies behaviour, niche occupation, and possibly evolution. ?? 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Isolation of bacteria from the luminous organ of the fish Monocentris japonica has revealed that the organ contains a pure culture of luminous bacteria. For the four fish examined, all contained Photobacterium fischeri as their luminous bacterial symbiont. This is the first time that P. fischeri has been identified in a symbiotic association. A representative isolate (MJl) of the light organ population was selected for in vivo studies of its luminous system. Several physiological features suggest adaptation for symbiotic existence. First, MJl has been shown to produce and respond to an inducer of luciferase that could accumulate in the light organ. Secondly, the specific activity of light production was seen to be maximal under low, growth-limiting concentrations of oxygen. Thirdly, unlike another luminous species (Beneckea harveyi), synthesis of the light production system of these bacteria is not catabolite repressed by glucose--a possible source of nutrition in the light organ. Fourthly, when grown aerobically on glucose these bacteria excrete pyruvic acid into the medium. This production of pyruvate is a major process, accounting for 30-40% of the glucose utilized and may serve as a form of regulatory and nutritional communication with the host.},

There is also a small group of natural conjugates, the sideromycins. Among the synthetic analogues that have been investigated are conjugates of nucleosides, glycopeptides, macrolides, fluroquinolones, and, above all, $\beta$-lactams. Despite this effort, few compounds have progressed beyond experimental studies. One compound, the siderophore monosulfactam BAL30072, is in early clinical studies.},

abstract = {The chiral BINOL-phosphoric acid catalyzed allylboration and propargylation reactions are studied with density functional theory (B3LYP and B3LYP-D3). Two different models were recently proposed for these reactions by Goodman and our group, respectively. In Goodman's model for allylborations, the catalyst interacts with the boronate pseudoaxial oxygen. By contrast, our model for propargylations predicts that the catalyst interacts with the boronate pseudoequatorial oxygen. In both models, the phosphoric acid stabilizes the transition state by forming a strong hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the boronate and is oriented by a formyl hydrogen bond (Goodman model) and by other electrostatic attractions in our model. Both of these models have now been reinvestigated for both allylborations and propargylations. For the most effective catalyst for these reactions, the lowest energy transition state corresponds to Goodman's axial model, while the best transition state leading to the minor enantiomer involves the equatorial model. The high enantioselectivity observed with only the bulkiest catalyst arises from the steric interactions between the substrates and the bulky groups on the catalyst, and the resulting necessity for distortion of the catalyst in the disfavored transition state.},

abstract = {The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulates the production of numerous virulence factors via the action of two separate but coordinated quorum sensing systems, las and rhl. These systems control the transcription of genes in response to population density through the intercellular signals N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-(butanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). A third P. aeruginosa signal, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone [Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS)], also plays a significant role in the transcription of multiple P. aeruginosa virulence genes. PQS is intertwined in the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing hierarchy with its production and bioactivity requiring the las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. This report presents a preliminary transcriptional analysis of pqsA, the first gene of the recently discovered PQS biosynthetic gene cluster. We show that pqsA transcription required pqsR, a transcriptional activator protein encoded within the PQS biosynthetic gene cluster. It was also found that the transcription of pqsA and subsequent production of PQS was induced by the las quorum sensing system and repressed by the rhl quorum sensing system. In addition, PQS production was dependent on the ratio of 3-oxo-C12-HSL to C4-HSL, suggesting a regulatory balance between quorum sensing systems. These data are an important early step toward understanding the regulation of PQS synthesis and the role of PQS in P. aeruginosa intercellular signaling. {\textcopyright} 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {Most prokaryotic signal-transduction systems and a few eukaryotic pathways use phosphotransfer schemes involving two conserved components, a his- tidine protein kinase and a response regulator protein. The histidine protein kinase, which is regulated by environmental stimuli, autophosphorylates at a histidine residue, creating a high-energy phosphoryl group that is subsequently transferred to an aspartate residue in the response regulator protein. Phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the regulatory domain that results in activation of an associated domain that effects the response. The basic scheme is highly adaptable, and numerous variations have provided optimization within specific signaling systems. The domains of two- component proteins are modular and can be integrated into proteins and pathways in a variety of ways, but the core structures and activities are maintained. Thus detailed analyses of a relatively small number of representative proteins provide a foundation for understanding this large family of signaling proteins.},

abstract = {OprJ, overproduced in nfxB multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and OprK, overproduced in the multidrug-resistant strain K385, were demonstrated to be immunologically cross-reactive using an OprJ-specific monoclonal antibody. Treatment of the purified proteins with trypsin or chymotrypsin yielded virtually indistinguishable digestion patterns, and the N-terminal sequence of two trypsin fragments was identical for both proteins, indicating that OprJ and OprK share identity. The N-terminal amino acid sequences were used to facilitate cloning of the oprJ gene on a 5kbp KpnI fragment and a 10kbp BamHI fragment. Nucleotide sequencing of portions of these fragments revealed that oprJ was the terminal gene in a putative three-gene operon, The predicted mexC–mexD–oprJ gene products exhibit homology to the MexA–MexB–OprM components of the multidrug-resistance efflux pump of P. aeruginosa (43–46\% identity). Consistent with an implied role for mexC–mexD–oprJ in drug efflux, the mexC–mexD–oprJ-hyperexpressing strain K385 showed reduced accumulation of a variety of antibiotics as compared with its parent strain, and this drug ‘exclusion' was abrogated by energy inhibitors. The mexC and oprJ products are putative lipoproteins of a molecular mass of 40707 and 51742Da, respectively, while mexD was predicted to encode a protein of 111936Da. Sequencing upstream of mexC revealed the presence of the nfxB gene transcribed divergently from the efflux genes. Overproduction of OprJ and the attendant multiple-antibiotic resistance of strain K385 was shown to result from a point mutation in nfxB, resulting in a H87→R change in the predicted NfxB polypeptide. OprJ overproduction and multidrug resistance in K385 was reversed by the cloned nfxB gene, suggesting that nfxB encodes a repressor of mexC–mexD–oprJ expression. Consistent with this, the cloned nfxB gene repressed synthesis of a mexC–lacZ fusion in Escherichia coli. nfxB also repressed expression of a nfxB–lacZ fusion, indicating that NfxB negatively regulates its own expression. These data indicate that the multidrug resistance of nfxB strains is due to overexpression of an efflux operon, mexC–mexD–oprJ, encoding components of a second efflux pump in P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {It is a hot clinical issue whether newly approved antimicrobial agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) and tigecycline are active enough to be used for infections caused by vancomycin resistant bacteria. We performed susceptibility tests for mupirocin, which is in widespread clinical use in Korea, and four new antimicrobials, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolated from Korean patients in 1998 and 2005 to evaluate and compare the in vitro activity of these antimicrobials. Among these agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin, which is rarely used in hospitals in Korea, showed relatively high resistance to several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated in 2005. Likewise, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline have not yet been in clinical use in Korea. However, our results showed that most of the 2005 VRE isolates were already resistant to linezolid and daptomycin (highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value >100 microg/ml). Compared with the other four antimicrobial agents tested in this study, tigecycline generally showed the greatest activity against VRE. However, four strains of 2005 isolates exhibited resistance against tigecycline (MIC >12.5 microg/ml). Almost all VRE were resistant to mupirocin, whereas all E. faecium isolated in 1998 were inhibited at concentrations between 0.8 to approximately 1.6 microg/ml. In conclusion, resistances to these new antimicrobial agents were exhibited in most of VRE strains even though these new antibiotics have been rarely used in Korean hospitals.},

abstract = {An optimized procedure for the efficient preparation of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (Pseudomonas quinolone signal or PQS) and a diverse range of structurally related 2-alkyl-4-quinolones with biological activity is presented. The two-step synthesis begins with the formation of $\alpha$-chloro ketones by the coupling of a Weinreb amide (2-chloro-N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide) and an appropriate Grignard reagent. The resulting $\alpha$-chloro ketones can be reacted with commercially available anthranilic acids under microwave irradiation conditions to furnish the desired 2-alkyl-4-quinolone products. As a typical example, the synthesis of PQS, a molecule involved in quorum sensing in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is described in detail. The first step of this process ($\alpha$-chloro ketone formation) takes ∼10 h in total to complete from commercially available bromoheptane and 2-chloro-N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide. The second step (microwave-assisted reaction with anthranilic acid) takes ∼14 h in total to complete (the reaction typically proceeds in ∼30 min, with work-up and purification requiring ∼13 h).},

@article{Takase2000,
abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces siderophores, pyoverdin and pyochelin, for high-affinity iron uptake. To investigate their contribution to P. aeruginosa infections, we constructed allelic exchange mutants from strain PAO1 which were deficient in producing one or both of the siderophores. When inoculated into the calf muscles of immunosuppressed mice, pyochelin-deficient and pyoverdin-deficient mutants grew and killed the animals as efficiently as PAO1. In contrast, the pyochelin- and pyoverdin-deficient (double) mutant did not show lethal virulence, although it did infect the muscles. On the other hand, when inoculated intranasally, all mutants grew in the lungs and killed immunosuppressed mice. Compared with PAO1, however, the pyoverdin-deficient mutant and the double mutant grew poorly in the lungs, and the latter was significantly attenuated for virulence. Irrespective of the inoculation route, the pyoverdin-deficient and doubly deficient mutants detected in the blood were significantly less numerous than PAO1. Additionally, in vitro examination demonstrated that the growth of the double mutant was extremely reduced under a free-iron-restricted condition with apotransferrin but that the growth reduction was completely canceled by supplementation with hemoglobin as a heme source. These results suggest that both pyoverdin and pyochelin are required for efficient bacterial growth and full expression of virulence in P. aeruginosa infection, although pyoverdin may be comparatively more important for bacterial growth and dissemination. However, the siderophores were not always required for infection. It is possible that non-siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, such as via heme uptake, might also play an important role in P. aeruginosa infections.},

abstract = {Summary The full elastolytic phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires lasB, the structural gene for elastase, its transcriptional activator lasR, and lasA. The lasB gene was insertionally inactivated with the omega fragment and this mutated gene introduced into the P. aeruginosa chromosome. Replacement of the wild-type gene with the inactivated gene was verified by Southern analysis and confirmed by lack of elastase antigen on Western blots and lack of activity in liquid assays. The mutant did, however, retain elastolytic activity on elastin plates. This residual activity was abolished by inactivation of lasB in PAO-E64, a lasA-deficient mutant, demonstrating that it was due to the lasA gene product. Northern analysis demonstrated that, like lasB, lasA is transcriptionally controlled by the lasR gene product.},

PQS, along with the isobaric 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), were quantified in various Pseudomonas liquid cultures using a deuterated PQS analog as internal standard. The kinetic of production of these quinolines in a growing culture of P. aeruginosa PA14 showed that their production starts at the end of the logarithmic growth phase and is maximal at the onset of the stationary growth phase. The concentration of PQS reached a maximum at 13 mg/l and then decreased, while the HQNO concentration reached 18 mg/l and then remained stable. Culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA14 produced similar concentrations of PQS whereas no PQS or HQNO could be detected in culture supernatants of the P. aeruginosa strain PAK or in the other Pseudomonas species tested, including phytopathogenic pseudomonads. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Microbes have developed resistance to nearly every antibiotic, yet the steps leading to drug resistance remain unclear. Here we report a multistage process by which Pseudomonas aeruginosa acquires drug resistance following exposure to ciprofloxacin at levels ranging from 0.5× to 8× the initial MIC. In stage I, susceptible cells are killed en masse by the exposure. In stage II, a small, slow to nongrowing population survives antibiotic exposure that does not exhibit significantly increased resistance according to the MIC measure. In stage III, exhibited at 0.5× to 4× the MIC, a growing population emerges to reconstitute the population, and these cells display heritable increases in drug resistance of up to 50 times the original level. We studied the stage III cells by proteomic methods to uncover differences in the regulatory pathways that are involved in this phenotype, revealing upregulation of phosphorylation on two proteins, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSADH), and also revealing upregulation of a highly conserved protein of unknown function. Transposon disruption in the encoding genes for each of these targets substantially dampened the ability of cells to develop the stage III phenotype. Considering these results in combination with computational models of resistance and genomic sequencing results, we postulate that stage III heritable resistance develops from a combination of both genomic mutations and modulation of one or more preexisting cellular pathways.},

The design of the conjugates was based on the earlier observation that conjugation of siderophore components to beta-lactam antibiotics induced active iron transport-mediated drug delivery. The novel conjugates (11 and 13) were synthesized by selective acylation of the primary amino group of 1. Preliminary biological studies indicated that siderophore modified vancomycins lost some activity (4- to 16-fold) against Gram-positive bacteria relative to vancomycin itself, and were generally similar to vancomycin in activity against Gram-negative bacteria under iron-sufficient conditions. However, under iron-depleted conditions which mimic human serum, conjugate 11 displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against an antibiotic hypersensitive strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

abstract = {The introduction of the fluoroquinolones (FQs) in the 1980s provided clinicians with a class of broad-spectrum agents ap- plicable to a range of gram-negative infections including uri- nary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, bone and joint infections, and infections of the skin and soft tissue (reviewed in references 10 and 43). Targeted microorganisms include the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Moraxella spp., which are highly susceptible to these agents, as well as important nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. FQs are less active but still clinically useful against Legionella spp. Given this broad spectrum of activity, it is unfortunate that resistance to FQs has increased in a number of gram-negative organisms, most notably in P. aeruginosa but in virtually all organisms where FQs have been employed (1, 43). Resistance is due usually to mutations in the genes for the bacterial targets of the FQs (DNA gyrase [GyrA] and topoisomerase IV [ParC]) or to active efflux of the agents via antibiotic efflux pumps (59). This review focuses on efflux mechanisms of FQ resistance, their distribution and clinical significance in gram- negative pathogens, the possible natural function(s) of these, and, finally, the potential therapeutic value of efflux pump inhibitors.

abstract = {Many bacterial species are capable of assessing their local population densities through a cell-cell signaling mechanism termed quorum sensing (QS). This intercellular communication process is mediated by small molecule or peptide ligands and their cognate protein receptors. Numerous pathogens use QS to initiate virulence once they achieve a threshold cell number on a host. Consequently, approaches to intercept QS have attracted considerable attention as potential anti-infective therapies. Our interest in the development of small molecule tools to modulate QS pathways motivated us to evaluate triazole-containing analogs of natural N-acyl L-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals as non-native QS agonists and antagonists in Gram-negative bacteria. We synthesized 72 triazole derivatives of five broad structure types in high yields and purities using efficient Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne couplings. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to activate or inhibit two QS receptors from two prevalent pathogens - LasR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and AbaR from Acinetobacter baumannii- using bacterial reporter strains. Several triazole derivatives were identified that were capable of strongly modulating the activity of LasR and AbaR. These compounds represent a new and synthetically accessible class of AHL analogs, and could find utility as chemical tools to study QS and its role in bacterial virulence.},

We obtained evidence that 1-(2-dipropylaminoethyl)-4-methoxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran hydrochloride 2a had selective affinity for sigma receptor over dopamine D2 receptor. This compound was designed to eliminate two bonds of apomorphine 1 to produce structural flexibility for the nitrogen atom and to bridge two benzene rings with a -CH2O- bond to maintain the planar structure. In light of the evidence, N, N-dipropyl-2-(4-methoxy-3-benzyloxylphenyl)ethylamine hydrochloride 10b was designed. Since compound 10b had eliminated a biphenyl bond of 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran derivative 2a, it might be more released from the rigid structure of apomorphine 1 than compound 2a. The chemical modification of compound 10b led to the discovery that N, N-dipropyl-2- [4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxyl)phenyl]ethylamine hydrochloride 10g (NE- 100), the best compound among arylalkoxyphenylalkylamine derivatives 3, had a high and selective affinity for sigma receptor and had a potent activity in an animal model when the drug was given orally.

The compounds, synthesized by literature procedures, were evaluated for activity against Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium smegmatis as well as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The activity of the compounds against M. fortuitum was used as a barometer of M. tuberculosis activity. The results demonstrate that (i) the activity against mycobacteria was related more to antibacterial activity than to changes in the lipophilicity of the compounds, (ii) the antimycobacterial activity imparted by the N-1 substituent was in the order tert-butyl > or = cyclopropyl > 2,4-difluorophenyl > ethyl approximately cyclobutyl > isopropyl, and (iii) substitution with either piperazine or pyrrolidine heterocycles at C-7 afforded similar activity against mycobacteria.},

abstract = {Microbial biofilms, prevalent in nature and inherently resistant to both antimicrobial agents and host defenses, can cause serious problems in the chemical, medical and pharmaceutical industries. Herein we demonstrated that conjugation of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (streptomycin) to chitosan could efficiently damage established biofilms and inhibit biofilm formation. This method was suitable to eradiate biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms, and it appeared that antibiotic contents, molecular size and positive charges of the conjugate were the key to retain this anti-biofilm activity. Mechanistic insight demonstrated chitosan conjugation rendered streptomycin more accessible into biofilms, thereby available to interact with biofilm bacteria. Thus, this work represent an innovative strategy that antibiotic covalently linked to carbohydrate carriers can overcome antibiotic resistance of microbial biofilms, and might provide a comprehensive solution to combat biofilms in industrial and medical settings.},

abstract = {Extracellular DNA is one of the major matrix components in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. It functions as an intercellular connector and plays a role in stabilization of the biofilms. Evidence that DNA release in P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms is controlled by the las-rhl and pqs quorum-sensing systems has been previously presented. This paper provides evidence that DNA release in P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms is also under iron regulation. Experiments involving cultivation of P. aeruginosa in microtitre trays suggested that pqs expression, DNA release and biofilm formation were favoured in media with low iron concentrations (5 microM FeCl(3)), and decreased with increasing iron concentrations. Experiments involving cultivation of P. aeruginosa in a flow-chamber system suggested that a high level of iron (100 microM FeCl(3)) in the medium suppressed DNA release, structural biofilm development, and the development of subpopulations with increased tolerance toward antimicrobial compounds. Experiments with P. aeruginosa strains harbouring fluorescent reporters suggested that expression of the pqs operon was induced in particular subpopulations of the biofilm cells under low-iron conditions (1 microM FeCl(3)), but repressed in the biofilm cells under high-iron conditions (100 microM FeCl(3)).},

abstract = {N-octanoyl cyclopentylamide (C8-CPA) was found to moderately inhibit quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. To obtain more powerful inhibitors, a series of structural analogs of C8-CPA were synthesized and examined for their ability to inhibit quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa PAO1. The lasB-lacZ and rhlA-lacZ reporter assays revealed that the chain length and the ring structure were critical for C8-CPA analogs to inhibit quorum sensing. N-decanoyl cyclopentylamide (C10-CPA) was found to be the strongest inhibitor, and its concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition for lasB-lacZ and rhlA-lacZ expression were 80 and 90 microM, respectively. C10-CPA also inhibited production of virulence factors, including elastase, pyocyanin, and rhamnolipid, and biofilm formation without affecting growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1. C10-CPA inhibited induction of both lasI-lacZ by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (PAI1) and rhlA-lacZ by N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (PAI2) in the lasI rhlI mutant of P. aeruginosa PAO1, indicating that C10-CPA interferes with the las and rhl quorum-sensing systems via inhibiting interaction between their response regulators (LasR and RhlR) and autoinducers.},

abstract = {The Vibrio fischeri luminescence genes are activated by an autoinducer and the 250-amino acid residue LuxR protein. To develop a general view of LuxR structure and function, a set of luxR 5'-deletion mutations was generated. Ten luxR mutant plasmids encoding active LuxR proteins with deletions ranging from residues 2-5 (delta 2-5) to residues 2-182 (delta 2-182) were studied. The degree of transcriptional activation of luminescence genes by the truncated LuxR proteins ranged from 0.01% to greater than 200% of the wild-type level. LuxR proteins with small deletions (up to delta 2-20) were active and remained autoinducer-dependent, LuxR proteins with deletions between residues 2-58 and 2-138 showed low activity and were not affected by autoinducer, and LuxR proteins with large deletions such as the delta 2-162 protein were highly active and autoinducer-independent. However, proteins with deletions equal to or greater than delta 2-20 were unable to autoregulate luxR. Our data indicate there is a C-terminal LuxR domain capable of functioning as a transcriptional activator. We suggest that an N-terminal region of LuxR starting between residues 20 and 58 and extending to the region of residues 138-162 masks the activator function of the C-terminal domain. Residues prior to position 20 are needed for autoregulatory function. Experiments showing that wild-type luxR is dominant over luxR genes coding the delta 2-58 through delta 2-138 proteins indicate the N-terminal arm masks lux DNA binding.},

abstract = {With the recent introduction of agents such as gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, the traditional gram-negative coverage of fluoroquinolones has been expanded to include specific gram-positive organisms. Clinical applications beyond genitourinary tract infections include upper and lower respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, gynecologic infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and some skin and soft tissue infections. Most quinolones have excellent oral bioavailability, with serum drug concentrations equivalent to intravenous administration. Quinolones have few adverse effects, most notably nausea, headache, dizziness, and confusion. Less common but more serious adverse events include prolongation of the corrected QT interval, phototoxicity, liver enzyme abnormalities, arthropathy, and cartilage and tendon abnormalities. The new fluoroquinolones are rarely first-line agents and should be employed judiciously. Inappropriate use of agents from this important class of antibiotics will likely worsen current problems with antibiotic resistance. Applications of fluoroquinolones in biologic warfare are also discussed.},

abstract = {MvfR (PqsR), a Pseudomonas aeruginosa LysR-type transcriptional regulator, plays a critical role in the virulence of this pathogen. MvfR modulates the expression of multiple quorum sensing (QS)-regulated virulence factors; and the expression of the phnAB and pqsA-E genes that encode functions mediating 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) signalling compounds biosynthesis, including 3,4-dihydroxy-2heptylquinoline (PQS) and its precursor 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ). PQS enhances the in vitro DNA-binding affinity of MvfR to the pqsA-E promoter, to suggest it might function as the in vivo MvfR ligand. Here we identify a novel MvfR ligand, as we show that HHQ binds to the MvfR ligand-binding-domain and potentiates MvfR binding to the pqsA-E promoter leading to transcriptional activation of pqsA-E genes. We show that HHQ is highly produced in vivo, where it is not fully converted into PQS, and demonstrate that it is required for MvfR-dependent gene expression and pathogenicity; PQS is fully dispensable, as pqsH-mutant cells, which produce HHI but completely lack PQS, display normal MvfR-dependent gene expression and virulence. Conversely, PQS is required for full production of pyocyanin. These results uncover a novel biological role for HHQ; and provide novel insights on MvfR activation that may aid in the development of therapies that prevent or treat P. aeruginosa infections in humans.},

abstract = {Recent advances in studies of bacterial gene expression have brought the realization that cell-to-cell communication and community behavior are critical for successful interactions with higher organisms. Species-specific cell-to-cell communication is involved in successful pathogenic or symbiotic interactions of a variety of bacteria with plant and animal hosts. One type of cell-cell signaling is acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria. This type of quorum sensing represents a dedicated communication system that enables a given species to sense when it has reached a critical population density in a host, and to respond by activating expression of genes necessary for continued success in the host. Acyl-homoserine lactone signaling in the opportunistic animal and plant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a model for the relationships among quorum sensing, pathogenesis, and community behavior. In the P. aeruginosa model, quorum sensing is required for normal biofilm maturation and for virulence. There are multiple quorum-sensing circuits that control the expression of dozens of specific genes that represent potential virulence loci.},

abstract = {Vibrio fischeri is the bacterial symbiont within the light-emitting organ of the sepiolid squid Euprymna scolopes. Upon colonizing juvenile squids, bacterial symbionts grow on host-supplied nutrients, while providing a bioluminescence that the host uses during its nocturnal activities. Mutant bacterial strains that are unable to emit light have been shown to be defective in normal colonization. A 606 bp open reading frame was cloned from V. fischeri that encoded a protein, which we named LitR, that had about 60% identity to four related regulator proteins: Vibrio cholerae HapR, Vibrio harveyi LuxR, Vibrio parahaemolyticus OpaR and Vibrio vulnificus SmcR. When grown in culture, cells of V. fischeri strain PMF8, in which litR was insertionally inactivated, were delayed in the onset of luminescence induction and emitted only about 20% as much light per cell as its parent. Protein-binding studies suggested that LitR enhances quorum sensing by regulating the transcription of the luxR gene. Interestingly, when competed against its parent in mixed inocula, PMF8 became the predominant symbiont present in 83% of light organs. Thus, the litR mutation appears to represent a novel class of mutations in which the loss of a regulatory gene function enhances the bacterium's competence in initiating a benign infection.},

@article{Pearson1995,
abstract = {Quorum sensing systems are used by a number of Gram-negative bacterial species to regulate specific sets of genes in a cell density-dependent manner. Quorum sensing involves synthesis and detection of extracellular signals termed autoinducers. As shown in recombinant Escherichia coli, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa autoinducer (PAI) N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone, together with the lasR gene product, activate the P. aeruginosa lasB gene. In this study, PAI was shown to activate lasB-lacZ expression in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant containing a plasmid with lasR under the control of the lac promoter. The concentration of PAI necessary for half-maximal activation of the lasB-lacZ fusion was approximately 1 microM, which is within the range of PAI levels found in P. aeruginosa culture fluids. The effect of PAI on a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant containing a plasmid with lasR under the control of its own promoter and containing the lasB-lacZ fusion was also tested. Although extracts of culture fluid activated the lasB promoter in this construct, concentrations of PAI as high as 10 microM did not. This indicates the presence of a second extracellular factor (factor 2) that is required for lasB activation in P. aeruginosa when lasR is controlled by its own promoter but not when lasR is controlled by a strong foreign promoter. Factor 2 was shown to be N-butyrylhomoserine lactone. Although recombinant E. coli cells containing the PAI synthase gene, lasI, produce PAI, these cells do not produce factor 2. Furthermore, a P. aeruginosa mutant that produced about 0.1% of the wild-type level of PAI made about 5% of the wild-type level of factor 2. This indicates that factor 2 synthesis results from the activity of a gene product other than PAI synthase. The role of factor 2 in virulence gene regulation remains to be determined, but this compound may affect the expression of lasR, which in turn activates transcription of numerous virulence genes in the presence of sufficient PAI. Apparently, multiple quorum sensing systems can occur and interact with each other in a single bacterial species.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a process by which bacteria use small molecules or peptidic signals to assess their local population densities. At sufficiently high density, bacteria can alter gene expression levels to regulate group behaviors involved in a range of important and diverse phenotypes, including virulence factor production, biofilm formation, root nodulation, and bioluminescence. Gram-negative bacteria most commonly use N-acylated l-homoserine lactones (AHLs) as their QS signals. The AHL lactone ring is hydrolyzed relatively rapidly at biological pH, and the ring-opened product is QS inactive. We seek to identify AHL analogues with heightened hydrolytic stability, and thereby potentially heightened activity, for use as non-native modulators of bacterial QS. As part of this effort, we probed the utility of thiolactone analogues in the current study as QS agonists and antagonists in Gram-negative bacteria. A focused library of thiolactone analogs was designed and rapidly synthesized in solution. We examined the activity of the library as agonists and antagonists of LuxR-type QS receptors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (LasR), Vibrio fischeri (LuxR), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (TraR) using bacterial reporter strains. The thiolactone library contained several highly active compounds, including some of the most active LuxR inhibitors and the most active synthetic TraR agonist reported to date. Analysis of a representative thiolactone analog revealed that its hydrolysis half-life was almost double that of its parent AHL in bacterial growth medium. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: A review of amphetamine treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was conducted, to obtain information on the long-term neurological consequences of this therapy. Method: Several databases were accessed for research articles on the effects of amphetamine in the brain of laboratory animals and ADHD diagnosed individuals. Results: In early studies, high doses of amphetamine, comparable to amounts used by addicts, were shown to damage dopaminergic pathways. More recent studies, using therapeutic regimens, appear contradictory. One paradigm shows significant decreases in striatal dopamine and transporter density after oral administration of “therapeutic” doses in primates. Another shows morphological evidence of “trophic” dendritic growth in the brains of adult and juvenile rats given systemic injections mimicking “therapeutic” treatment. Imaging studies of ADHD-diagnosed individuals show an increase in striatal dopamine transporter availability that may be reduced by methylphenidate treatment. Conclusion: Clarification of the neurological consequences of chronic AMPH treatment for ADHD is needed. (J. of Att. Dis. 2007; 11(1) 8-16)

@article{Winzer2000,
abstract = {In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, many exoproduct virulence determinants are regulated via a hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving the transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR and their cognate activators, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). In this paper, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic lectins PA-IL and PA-IIL are regulated via quorum sensing. Using immunoblot analysis, the production of both lectins was found to be directly dependent on the rhl locus while, in a lasR mutant, the onset of lectin synthesis was delayed but not abolished. The PA-IL structural gene, lecA, was cloned and sequenced. Transcript analysis indicated a monocistronic organization with a transcriptional start site 70 bp upstream of the lecA translational start codon. A lux box-type element together with RpoS (ς(S)) consensus sequences was identified upstream of the putative promoter region. In Escherichia coli, expression of a lecA::lux reporter fusion was activated by RhlR/C4-HSL, but not by LasR/3O-C12-HSL, confirming direct regulation by RhlR/C4-HSL. Similarly, in P. aeruginosa PAO1, the expression of a chromosomal lecA::lux fusion was enhanced but not advanced by the addition of exogenous C4-HSL but not 3O-C12-HSL. Furthermore, mutation of rpoS abolished lectin synthesis in P. aeruginosa, demonstrating that both RpoS and RhlR/C4-HSL are required. Although the C4-HSL-dependent expression of the lecA::lux reporter in E. coli could be inhibited by the presence of 3O-C12-HSL, this did not occur in P. aeruginosa. This suggests that, in the homologous genetic background, 3O-C12-HSL does not function as a posttranslational regulator of the RhlR/C4-HSL-dependent activation of lecA expression.},

abstract = {Synthesis and detection of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) enables many gram-negative bacteria to engage in quorum sensing, an intercellular signaling mechanism that activates differentiation to virulent and biofilm lifestyles. The AHL synthases catalyze acylation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine by acyl-acyl carrier protein and lactonization of the methionine moiety to give AHLs. The crystal structure of the AHL synthase, EsaI, determined at 1.8 ?? resolution, reveals a remarkable structural similarity to the N-acetyltransferases and defines a common phosphopantetheine binding fold as the catalytic core. Critical residues responsible for catalysis and acyl chain specificity have been identified from a modeled substrate complex and verified through functional analysis in vivo. A mechanism for the N-acylation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine by 3-oxo-hexanoyl-acyl carrier protein is proposed.},

abstract = {Vibrio fischeri quorum sensing involves the LuxI and LuxR proteins. The LuxI protein generates the quorum-sensing signal N-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL), and LuxR is a signal-responsive transcriptional regulator which activates the luminescence (lux) genes and 17 other V. fischeri genes. For activation of the lux genes, LuxR binds to a 20-base-pair inverted repeat, the lux box, which is centered 42.5 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start of the lux operon. Similar lux box-like elements have been identified in only a few of the LuxR-activated V. fischeri promoters. To better understand the DNA sequence elements required for LuxR binding and to identify binding sites in LuxR-regulated promoters other than the lux operon promoter, we have systematically mutagenized the lux box and evaluated the activity of many mutants. By doing so, we have identified nucleotides that are critical for promoter activity. Interestingly, certain lux box mutations allow a 3OC6-HSL-independent LuxR activation of the lux operon promoter. We have used the results of the mutational analysis to create a consensus lux box, and we have used this consensus sequence to identify LuxR binding sites in 3OC6-HSL-activated genes for which lux boxes could not be identified previously.},

abstract = {A pure culture of the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri is maintained in the light-emitting organ of the sepiolid squid Euprymna scolopes. When the juvenile squid emerges from its egg it is symbiont-free and, because bioluminescence is part of an anti-predatory behavior, therefore must obtain a bacterial inoculum from the surrounding environment. We document here the kinetics of the process by which newly hatched juvenile squids become infected by symbiosis-competent V. fischeri. When placed in seawater containing as few as 240 colony-forming-units (CFU) per ml, the juvenile became detectably bioluminescent within a few hours. Colonization of the nascent light organ was initiated with as few as 1 to 10 bacteria, which rapidly began to grow at an exponential rate until they reached a population size of approximately 10(5) cells by 12 h after the initial infection. Subsequently, the number of bacteria in the established symbiosis was maintained essentially constant by a combination of both a > 20-fold reduction in bacterial growth rate, and an expulsion of excess bacteria into the surrounding seawater. While V. fischeri cells are normally flagellated and motile, these bacteria did not elaborate these appendages once the symbiosis was established; however, they quickly began to synthesize flagella when they were removed from the light organ environment. Thus, two important biological characteristics, growth rate and flagellation, were modulated during establishment of the association, perhaps as part of a coordinated series of symbiotic responses.},

abstract = {Chemical coordination of gene expression among bacteria as a function of population density is regulated by a mechanism known as 'quorum sensing' (QS). QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that causes disease in immunocompromised patients, is mediated by binding of the transcriptional activator, LasR, to its ligand, 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL, leading to population-wide secretion of virulence factors and biofilm formation. We have targeted QS in P. aeruginosa with a set of electrophilic probes designed to covalently bind Cys79 in the LasR binding pocket, leading to specific inhibition of QS-regulated gene expression and concomitant reduction of virulence factor secretion and biofilm formation. This first example of covalent modification of a QS receptor provides a new tool to study molecular mechanisms of bacterial group behavior and could lead to new strategies for targeting bacterial virulence.},

This unique property is controlled by dynamic interplays between extrinsic signalling, epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Recent research indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by repressing the translation of selected mRNAs in stem cells and differentiating daughter cells. Such a role has been shown in embryonic stem cells, germline stem cells and various somatic tissue stem cells. These findings reveal a new dimension of gene regulation in controlling stem cell fate and behaviour.},

abstract = {Two distinct but interrelated pheromone-signaling systems, LuxI/LuxR and AinS/AinR, positively control bioluminescence in Vibrio fischeri. Although each system generates an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal, the protein sequences of LuxI/LuxR and AinS/AinR are unrelated. AinS and LuxI generate the pheromones N-octanoyl-AHL (C8-AHL) and N-3-oxo-hexanoyl-AHL (3OC6-AHL), respectively. LuxR is a transcriptional activator that responds to 3OC6-AHL, and to a lesser extent to C8-AHL. AinR is hypothesized to respond to C8-AHL and, based on homology to Vibrio harveyi LuxN, to mediate the repression of a Qrr regulatory RNA. However, a $\Delta$ainR mutation decreased luminescence, which was not predicted based on V. harveyi LuxN, raising the possibility of a distinct regulatory mechanism for AinR. Here we show that ainR can complement a luxN mutant, suggesting functional similarity. Moreover, in V. fischeri, we observed ainR-dependent repression of a Pqrr-lacZ transcriptional reporter in the presence of C8-AHL, consistent with its hypothesized regulatory role. The system appears quite sensitive, with a half-maximal effect on a Pqrr reporter at 140 pM C8-AHL. Several other AHLs with substituted and unsubstituted acyl chains between 6 and 10 carbons also displayed an AinR-dependent effect on Pqrr-lacZ; however, AHLs with acyl chains of four carbons or 12 or more carbons lacked activity. Interestingly, 3OC6-AHL also affected expression from the qrr promoter, but this effect was largely luxR dependent, indicating a previously unknown connection between these systems. Finally, we propose a preliminary explanation for the unexpected luminescence phenotype of the $\Delta$ainR mutant.},

In order to attenuate P. aeruginosa pathogenicity, we followed a ligand-based drug design approach and synthesized a series of compounds targeting PqsR, the receptor of the pqs system. In vitro evaluation using a reporter gene assay in Escherichia coli led to the discovery of the first competitive PqsR antagonists, which are highly potent (Kd,appof compound 20: 7 nM). These antagonists are able to reduce the production of the virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa.

All of the isolates were the luminous psychrotrophic bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. This bacterium is the luminous species best suited to the cold temperatures of the deep-sea habitats where these fish families are encountered. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that luminous bacteria from luminescent organs of shallower water fishes of the temperate regions (Monocentridae) and tropics (Leiognathidae) contain the mesotrophic bacteria P. fischeri and P. leiognathi, respectively. The differences in luminous bacterial symbionts, the distant phylogenetic relationships, and the marked differences in the structure and location of the luminescent organ among these four fish families suggest an independent and multiple origin of each of these bacteria-fish associations. ?? 1978.},

@article{Latifi1996,
abstract = {Summary In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the production of many virulence factors and secondary metabolites is regulated in concert with cell density through quorum sensing. Two quorum-sensing regulons have been identified in which the LuxR homologues LasR and RhIR are activated by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homo-serine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (BHL) respectively. The lasR and rhIR genes are linked to the luxl homologues last and rhll, which are responsible for synthesis of OdDHL and BHL, respectively. As lasRI and rhlRI are both involved in regulating synthesis of exoenzymes such as elastase, we sought to determine the nature of their interrelationship. By using lacZ transcriptional fusions in both homologous (P. aeruginosa) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) genetic backgrounds we provide evidence that (i) lasR is expressed constitutively throughout the growth cycle, (ii) rhIR expression is regulated by LasR/OdDHL, and (iii) that RhIR/BHL regulates rhll. We also show that expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor gene rpoS is abolished in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant and in the pleiotropic BHL-negative mutant PAN067. Furthermore, our data reveal that in E. coli, an rpoS-lacZ fusion is regulated directly by RhIR/BHL. Taken together, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa employs a multilayered hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving RhIR/BHL and LasR/OdDHL, interlinked via RpoS, to integrate the regulation of virulence determinants and secondary metabolites with adaptation and survival in the stationary phase.},

abstract = {Density-dependent expression of luminescence in Vibrio harveyi is regulated by the concentration of extracellular signal molecules (autoinducers) in the culture medium. One signal-response system is encoded by the luxL,M,N locus. The luxL and luxM genes are required for the production of an autoinducer (probably beta-hydroxybutyl homoserine lactone), and the luxN gene is required for the response to that autoinducer. Analysis of the phenotypes of LuxL,M and N mutants indicated that an additional signal-response system also controls density sensing. We report here the identification, cloning and analysis of luxP and luxQ, which encode functions required for a second density-sensing system. Mutants with defects in luxP and luxQ are defective in response to a second autoinducer substance. LuxQ, like LuxN, is similar to members of the family of two-component, signal transduction proteins and contains both a histidine protein kinase and a response regulator domain. Analysis of signalling mutant phenotypes indicates that there are at least two separate signal-response pathways which converge to regulate expression of luminescence in V. harveyi.},
